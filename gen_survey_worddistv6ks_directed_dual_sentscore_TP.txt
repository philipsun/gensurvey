Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
The proposed model is extractive(  summaries are built by extracting sentences from the original texts)  and non focused(  the summarization is not guided by a specific information need). 
We chose these particular kernels because their general forms have intuitive interpretations for event matching and can be easily adjusted to fit our needs for event centered text comparison. 
Furthermore,  considering that numerous textual sources provide information about the same real world events,  the need for aggregating and summarizing the most relevant information has become obvious. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
Text generation patterns can be used,  based on some knowledge about the topic or the information needs of the user. 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
Therefore,  one needs a representation of text which will enable semantic similarity determination between two texts. 
Nevertheless,  it is quite probable that the words expressing the content will exist in the same context or that part of the words used will be identical,  for example,  if different in ections are used. 
Tackling the problem of what kind of information should be used to represent a peer and a model summary in the evaluation of a summary,  one should take into account that the surface appearance of two equivalent pieces of the same semantic content need not be identical as happens in the case of paraphrases Zhou et al   2006. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Although ROUGE takes into account contextual information,  it remains at the word level,  which means we either regard different types of the same word as different or we need to apply(  language dependent)  stemming or lemmatization to remove this effect. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
In (0079):
The use of rare words or technical terminology for example can make text difficult to read for certain audience types(  CollinsThompson and Call an,  2004; Sch warm Schwa rm and Ostendorf,  2005; Elhadad and Sutaria,  2007). 
Coherent text is characterized by various types of cohesive links that facilitate text comprehension(  Halliday and Has an,  1976). 
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non discourse features(  Miltsakaki and Kukich,  2000). 
In (Carlson et-al. 2003):
Thus,  our approach contributes to the community quite differently from detailed analyses of specific discourse phenomena in depth,  such as anaphoric relations(  Gar side et al,  1997)  or style types(  Leech et al,  1997)  ; analysis of a single text from multiple perspectives(  Mann and Thompson,  1992)  ; or illustrations of a theoretical model on a single representative text(  Brit ton Britt on and Black,  1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch,  1983). 
The annotators hired to build the corpus were all professional language analysts with prior experience in other types of data annotation. 
textual organization,  span,  and same unit(  used to link parts of units separated by embedded units or spans). 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
a pure statistical approach based on HMMs. 
On the other hand,  we expect that the purely statistical HMMbased approach will be more robust to text from different genres. 
Specifically,  a sentence selector builds the final summary by choosing among the candidates,  based on features propagated from the sentence compression method,  features of the candidates themselves,  and features of the present summary state. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
In this article,  we present event graphs,  a novel event based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. 
To construct the event graphs,  we combine machine learning and rule based models to extract sentence level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. 
To adequately capture the semantics of events,  we introduce event graphs,  a novel event centered document representation based on sentence level event mentions. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Nowadays,  corpus based approaches play an important role in text summarization(  Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; Lin & Hovy,  1997; Teufel & Mo ens,  1997; Yeh et al,  2002). 
outperforms keyword based text summarization approaches. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
Latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  is a mathematical technique for extracting and inferring relations of expected contextual usage of words in passages of discourse(  Deer wester et al,  1990; Landau er et al,  1998). 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
Simulation experiments suggest that this technique is useful because it moves away from a purely keyword based method of textual information extraction and its associated limitations. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
In (Pang and Lee 2008):

E g,  using a na ve Bayesian classifier with a set of data features attributes extracted from training sentences(  Wiebeet al   ACL99). 
Feature based opinion mining and summarization Comparative sentence and relation extraction Summary. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
An abs tractive summarization method consists of understanding the original text and retelling it in fewer words. 
Summarization tools may also search for headings and other markers of subtopics in order to identify the key points of a document. 
In multi document summarization,  rdq will be 1 exactly when d is in the document set corresponding to query q. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
In order to implement extractive summarization,  some sentence extraction techniques are utilized to identify the most important sentences,  which can express the overall understanding of a given document. 
Extractive summarization is a simple but robust method for text summarization and it involves assigning saliency scores to some textual units of the documents and extracting those with highest scores. 
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
In the literature,  the development of multi document summarization has been largely promoted by the Document Understanding Conferences(  DUC)  2 and Text Analysis Conferences(  TAC)  .3. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
evaluation frameworks uses statistical measures of similarity based on ngrams of words,  4 although it supports different kinds of analysis,  ranging from ngram to semantic Hovy et al   b. 
A number of different intermediate representations of summaries information have been introduced in existing summarization evaluation literature,  ranging from automatically extracted snippets to human decided sub sentential portions of text. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
Text summarization based on fuzzy logic system architecture. 
Automatic text summarization based on fuzzy logic. 
Extractive summaries are formulated by extracting key text segments(  sentences or passages)  from the text,  based on statistical analysis of individual or mixed surface level features such as word phrase frequency,  location or cue words to locate the sentences to be extracted. 
In (Rush et-al. 2015):
Summarization based on text extraction is inherently limited,  but generation style abs tractive methods have proven challenging to build. 
To test the effectiveness of this approach we run extensive comparisons with multiple abs tractive and extractive baselines,  including traditional syntax based systems,  integer linear program constrained systems,  information retrieval style approaches,  as well as statistical phrase based machine translation. 
Finally,  we use a phrase based statistical machine translation system trained on Gigaword to produce summaries,  MOSES+(  Koehn et al,  2007). 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Subjective opinions are often critical in many conversations. 
In (Carenini et-al. 2007):
Since we are studying multiple email summarization in a conversational context,  we required that each conversation contained at least 4 emails. 
This clearly shows that the hidden emails do carry crucial information and have to be considered by the email summarization system. 
Not only does this study provide a gold standard to evaluate CWS and other summarization methods,  but it also sheds light on the importance of clue words and hidden emails to human summarizers. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
Automatic summarization Complex networks Network measurements Sentence extraction Summary informativeness. 
In this paper,  we employ concepts and metrics of complex networks to select sentences for an extractive summary.

to tackle the summarization problem by combining complex network analysis. 
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (Ferreira et-al. 2014):
The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an unsupervised generic summarization system,  that makes linguistic treatment of the input text by performing co reference resolution and discourse analysis,  besides using statistical and semantic similarities,  as in all previous work in the literature. 
The 2002 conference was the last one that proposed the contest to create generic multi document summaries. 
In general,  multi document summarization is either generic(  also termed extractive) (  Alguliev,  Aliguliyev,  & Hajirahimova,  a)  or query based(  Luo,  Zhuang,  He,  & Shi,  2013). 
In (Liu et-al. 2009):
The experiments,  both on the task 1 of DUC02 which focuses on generic single document summarizing,  and on the main task of DUC07 whose goal is to produce a query based summary for a set of related documents,  illustrate that our proposed approaches achieve a stateoftheart performance Particularly noteworthy about our approach are the following points. 
The proposed approach is described in Section 3,  followed by evaluations both on a generic single document setting,  and on a query based multidocumentsetting in Section 4. 
Based on this proposed word information qu anti cation measure,  a sentence ssigni cance value for a generic summarization is computed using(  5)  where m is the number of words in sentence s,  I(  w)  is set to 1 when w is a keyword,  otherwise,  info(  w)  is equivalent to info(  w)  in(  2)  when w is a keyword,  otherwise When the documents to be processed are news articles,  a feature about sentence. 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Section 2 presents the different text feature parameters,  Section 3 is about the proposed automatic summarization model,  Section 4 shows the experimental results and finally Section 5 presents conclusions and future work. 
In (Almeida and Martins 2013):
Automatic text summarization is a seminal problem in information retrieval and natural language processing(  Luhn,  1958; Baxendale,  1958; Edmund son,  1969). 
In Stan Szpakowicz MarieFrancine Mo ens,  editor,  Text Summarization Branches Out. 
We present a dual decomposition framework for multi document summarization,  using a model that jointly extracts and compresses sentences. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The DPP models outperform the baselines in most cases furthermore,  there is a signi cant boost in performance due to the use of DPP maximum likelihood training in place of logistic regression.

In query based text summarization. 
If users create query words the way they create for information retrieval,  then the query based summary generation would become generic summarization. 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  modeled extractive document summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences.

In (Ferreira et-al. 2013):
Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive. 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded. 
It discovers and exploits association rules to represent the correlations among multiple terms that have been neglected by previous approaches. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
In the rst,  we subtract a multiple of one of the vectors in V from all of the other vectors so that they are zero in the ithcomponent,  leaving us with a set of vectors spanning the subspace of V orthogonal to ei. 
We assume that the conditional DPP kernel L(  X ; θ)  is parameterized in terms ofa generic θ,  and let denote the conditional probability of an output Y given input X under parameter θ. 
Our input will be a still image depicting multiple people,  and our goal is to simultaneously identify the poses the positions of the torsos,  heads,  and left and right arms of all the people in the image. 
4.14-tIncorporating various levels of language analysis for tackling redundancy in text summarization
4.15-tEvolutionary optimization algorithm for summarizing multiple documents
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005).

In (Yang et-al. 2014):
Recall that our goal is to obtain more accurate sentence clusters and generate good summaries in theme based summarization. 
Thus,  good sentence clusters are the guarantee of good summaries in theme based summarization. 
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters.

,  uses modified TF*IDF to produce clusters of news articles on the same event We developed a new technique for multidocumentsummarization(  or MDS) ,  called centroidbasedsummarization(  CBS)  which uses as input the centroids of the clusters produced by CIDR to identify which sentences are central to the topic of the oft he cluster,  rather than the individual articles. 
Finally,  we describe two user studies that test our models of multidocumentsummarization. 
4.22-tSummarization of multiple documents based on social Folksonomy by analyzing semantically
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
Finally,  we create a summary of multiple documents by analyzing the importance of each word and its semantic relatedness to others.

4.23.2-tSemantic role labeling with minimal resources
In (Khan et-al. 2015):
In this framework,  contents of the source documents are represented by predicate argument structures by employing semantic role labeling. 
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. 
Our work,  in contrast,  aims to treat this limitation by using semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique to build semantic representation from the document text automatically. 
To the best of our knowledge,  semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique,  which exploits semantic role parser,  has not been employed for the semantic representation oftextin multi document abs tractive summarization. 
In (Kaljahi et-al. 2014):
This paper describes a series of French semantic role la belling label ling experiments which show that a small set of manually annotated training data is superior to a much larger set containing semantic role labels which have been projected from a source language via word alignment. 
Moreover,  there seems to be no improvement gained from projecting semantic roles between direct translations than between indirect translations. 
Semantic role la belling label ling(  SRL) (  Gild ea and Jurafsky,  2002)  is the task of identifying the predicates in a sentence,  their semantic arguments and the roles these arguments take.

4.23.7-tGraph-based extractive summarization by considering importance, non-redundancy and coherence
In (Parveen and Strube 2015):
We propose a graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization which considers importance,  non redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. 
Therefore,  in our work,  computing importance,  non redundancy and coherence is tightly integrated and taken care of simultaneously Our graph based summarization technique has the further advantage of being completely unsupervised We apply our graph based summarization technique to scienti c articles from the journal PLOS Medicine,  a high impact open access journal from the medical domain. 
Hence,  we optimize importance,  non redundancy and coherence simultaneously. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
A graph,  or network,  is a representation that may capture text structure in various ways,  being therefore suitable for extractive summarization. 
In (CR100):
However,  preliminary experiments carried out prove that the combination of extractive and abs tractive information is a more suitable strategy to adopt towards the generation of abstracts.KeywordsHuman Language Technologies,  automated retrieval and mining,  automated content summarization,  abs tractive techniques,  graph based algorithms. 
Moreover,  in order to decide which of the new sentences should be included in the abs tractive summary,  an extractive text summarization approach is developed(  i e,  COMPENDIUM) ,  so that the most relevant abs tractive sentence scan sentences can be selected and extracted.

4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Several real world machine learning applications involve hierarchy based categorization of topics for a set of objects. 
Our approach is based on sub modular maximization and mixture learning,  which has been successfully used in applications such as document summarization(  Lin,  2012)  and image summarization(  Tschiatschek et al,  2014) ,  but has never been applied to topic identification tasks or,  more generally,  DAG summarization. 
Given a collection of articles spanning different topics,  but with similar titles,  automatically generate a disambiguation page for those titles using the Wikipedia category hierarchy as a topic DAG. 
In (Wang and Li 2012):
Given a collection of documents,  a variety of summarization methods based on different strategies have been proposed to extract the most important sentences from the original documents. 
As a good ensemble requires the diversity of the individual members,  in this paper,  we first study the most widely used multi document summarization systems based on a variety of strategies(  e g,  the centroid based method,  the graph based method,  LSA,  and NMF) ,  and evaluate different baseline combination methods(  e g,  average score,  average rank,  Borda count,  median aggregation,  round robin scheme,  correlation based weighting method,  and graph based combination)  for obtaining a consensus summarizer to improve the summarization performance. 
Multi document summarization is a fundamental tool for document understanding and has received much attention recently. 
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,  increasing the quality of the updates. 
Our system predicts sentence salience in the context of a large scale event,  such as a disaster,  and integrates these predictions into a clustering based multi document summarization system. 
The AP+SALIENCE model is better able to find salient updates earlier on for the disaster domain,  this is an especially important quality of the model.

For instance,  in Figure a weak pose detector favors large clusters of poses that are nearly identical,  but lteringthrough a DPP ensures that the nal predictions are well separated Throughout this survey we demonstrate applications for DPPs in a variety of settings,  including. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The goal of learning is to choose appropriate θ based on the training sample so that we can make accurate predictions on unseen inputs While there are a variety of ob jective functions commonly used for learning,  here we will focus on maximum likelihood learning(  or maximum likelihood estimation,  often abbreviatedMLE) ,  where the goal is to choose θ to maximize the conditional log likelihood of the Optimizing L is consistent under mild assumptions that is,  if the training data are actually drawn from a conditional DPP with parameter θ∗,  then the learned θ → θ∗ as T → Of course real data are unlikely to exactly follow any particular model,  but in any case reasonable probability estimates,  since maximizing L can be seen as minimizing the loglossthe maximum likelihood approach has the advantage of calibrating the DPP to produce on the training data To optimize the log likelihood,  we will use standard algorithms such as gradient ascent or LBFGS Nocedal,  1980. 
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
This is the focus of our work reported here,  including the necessity to eliminate redundancy among the information content of multiple related documents. 
Specifically,  we are constructing sets of 10 documents,  which either contain a snapshot of an event from multiple sources or the unfoldment of an event over time. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents.

4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In (Graham 2015):
An analysis of evaluation of summarization metrics was provided with an evaluation of BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE. 
In total,  therefore,  when employing ROUGE for the evaluation of summarization systems,  there are 192(  8 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2)  possible system level variants to choose from. 
Automatic metrics of summarization evaluation have their origins in machine translation(  MT) ,  with ROUGE(  Lin and Hovy,  2003) ,  the first and still most widely used automatic summarization metric,  comprising an adaption of the BLEU score(  Papineni et al,  2002). 
In (Lin 2004):
In this paper,  we introduced ROUGE,  an automatic evaluation package for summarization,  and conducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic measures included in the ROUGE package using three years of DUC data. 
We found that(  1)  ROUGE2,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  and ROUGES worked well in single document summarization tasks, (  2)  ROUGE1,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 performed great in evalua ting very short summaries(  or headline like summaries) , (  3)  correlation of high 90% was hard to achieve for multi document summarization tasks but ROUGE1,  ROUGE2,  ROUGES4,  ROUGES9,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 worked reasonably well when stop words were exc luded from match ing, (  4)  exclusion of stop words usually improved correlation,  and(  5)  correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references. 
We found that correlations were not affected by stemming or removal of stop words in this data set,  ROUGE2 performed be tter among the ROUGEN variants,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  and ROUGES were all performing well,  and using mu ltiple references improved pe rformance though not much. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
As described in Section 4.2.1,  ROUGE is an automatic evaluation metric for text summarization based on ngram overlap statistics Lin,  We report three standard variants. 
Figure 12 depicts a sample cluster from the test set To measure performance on this task we follow the original evaluation and use ROUGE,  an automatic evaluation metric for summarization Lin,  2004. 
We demonstrate learning for the conditional DPP quality model on an extractive multi document summarization task using news text. 
4.24-tPro and Cons
5-tComparison of recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In (CR100):
In light of this,  Text Summarization(  TS)  is of great help since its main aim is to produce a condensed new text containing a significant portion of the information in the original text(  s)  The process of summarization can be divided into three stages. 
Moreover,  in order to decide which of the new sentences should be included in the abs tractive summary,  an extractive text summarization approach is developed(  i e,  COMPENDIUM) ,  so that the most relevant abs tractive sentence scan sentences can be selected and extracted. 
This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
This paper proposes two approaches to address text summarization. 
Table 1 shows the outputs of our approaches in different phases of the text summarization process. 
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
To effectively address the summarization problem in a multilingual context in. 
Multi document summarization Text mining Association rule mining Graph ranking. 
The multi document summarization task entails generating a summary of a collection of textual documents. 
The raw textual content is commonly unsuitable for use in item set items et and association rule mining. 
GraphSum performs better than many stateoftheart approaches,  including those that heavily rely on advanced semantics based models(  e g,  ontologies)  or complex linguistic processing steps.

In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Furthermore,  the results suggest that similar event based approaches could be used to address closely related NLP tasks such as text simplification. 
Nonetheless,  the majority of information retrieval and text summarization methods rely on shallow document representations that do not account for the semantics of events.

In (Patel et-al. 2007):
So,  evaluation in terms of informativeness is usually preferred. 
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e. 
Thus,  after preprocessing we have made the text suitable for extracting important sentences.

Others considered previously selected patterns in item set items et evaluation to reduce model redundancy. 
Experimental results,  performed on the DUC’04 document collection by means of ROUGE toolkit,  show that the proposed approach achieves better performance than a large set of competitors. 
Sentence evaluation and selection steps consider(  i)  a sentence relevance score that combines the tfidf statistics. 
trjk(  Ii)  =(  1 if Ii ⊆ trjk,  0 otherwise(  2)  The coverage of a sentence sjk with respect to the pattern based model is defined as the number of ones that occur in the corresponding coverage vector SCjk. 
In (Shen et-al. 2007):
A second evaluation method is by the ROUGE toolkit,  which is based on Ngram statistics Lin and Hovy,  2003. 
Many methods,  including supervised and unsupervised algorithms,  have been developed for extractive document summarization. 
A similar method is to select the lead sentence in each paragraph. 
In (He et-al. 2012):
We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence. 
8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
Our text summarization algorithm is based on computing the value of aTFISF(  term frequency – inverse sentence frequency)  measure for each word,  which is an adaptation of the conventional TFIDF(  term frequency – inverse document frequency)  measure of information retrieval. 
However,  the textual,  unstructured nature of documents makes these two text mining tasks considerably more difficult than their data mining counterparts. 
In (Dunlavy et-al. 2007):
We demonstrate the improved performance by a series of experiments using standard test sets from the Document Understanding Conferences(  DUC)  as measured by the best known automatic metric for summarization system evaluation,  ROUGE. 
Information retrieval Latent semantic indexingClusteringSummarizationText processing Sentence trimming. 
In many of the DUC evaluations,  similar lead sentence summaries have been used as baselines,  representing a summarization approach requiring minimal text and or natural language processing.
