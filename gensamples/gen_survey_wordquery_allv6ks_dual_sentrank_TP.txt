Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Hearst 1997):
With the increase in importance of multimedia information,  especially in the context of Digital Library projects,  the need for segmentation and summarization of alternative media types is becoming increasingly important. 
Salton et al  (  1996)  have recognized the need for multi paragraph multipara graph units in the automatic creation of hypertext links as well as theme generation(  this work is discussed in Section 5). 
First,  Nomoto and Nit ta(  1994)  use too large an interval words because this is approximately the average size needed for their implementation of the blocks version of TextTiling. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Thus,  there is a need for automatic text summarization for the languages in order to subdue this constantly increasing amount of electronically produced text. 
Precision(  the fraction of the text portions retrieved that are relevant to user s information need)  and recall(  the fraction of the text portions that are relevant to the topic that are successfully retrieved)  are the two performance measure used for determining the quality of the summary. 
We present an approach of identifying the most prominent text sentences using various shallow linguistic features,  taking degree of connective ness among the text units into consideration so as to minimize the poorly linked sentences in the resulting summary. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
Text generation patterns can be used,  based on some knowledge about the topic or the information needs of the user. 
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (0079):
Coherent text is characterized by various types of cohesive links that facilitate text comprehension(  Halliday and Has an,  1976). 
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non discourse features(  Miltsakaki and Kukich,  2000). 
The use of rare words or technical terminology for example can make text difficult to read for certain audience types(  CollinsThompson and Call an,  2004; Sch warm Schwa rm and Ostendorf,  2005; Elhadad and Sutaria,  2007). 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
systems(  4) ,  types(  3) ,  solutions(  3) ,  minimal(  3) ,  linear(  2) ,  in equations(  2) ,  algorithms(  2). 
Upper bounds for components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given. 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Although GistSumm also determines the gist of a source text,  its approach is purely statistical,  avoiding the inherent complexity of those deep based ones. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2012):
In this paper we present a multi document summarizer that combines the knowledge provided by an itemsetbased model with a statistical evaluator,  based on tfidf statistics,  to select the most representative and not redundant sentences. 
ItemSum is a novel summarizer that selects the most representative sentences based on both their coverage of an itemsetbased model and their single word statistical relevance. 
Unlike previous approaches,  it exploits an entropy based heuristics to drive the mining process and select the most informative yet not redundant item sets without the need of a post pruning step. 
In (Rush et-al. 2015):
To test the effectiveness of this approach we run extensive comparisons with multiple abs tractive and extractive baselines,  including traditional syntax based systems,  integer linear program constrained systems,  information retrieval style approaches,  as well as statistical phrase based machine translation. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
As mentioned in Section 1,  motivated by the success of PageRanklike ranking algorithms in webpage ranking,  a number of graph based approaches have been applied to automatic text summarization. 
We use the graph based ranking algorithm similar to the topic sensitive LexRank in Otterbacher et al  (  2005)  as our first step to rank sentences in the documents,  which is also used for comparison as our baseline without query expansion. 
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
Graph based ranking algorithms like Klein berg s HITS algorithm(  Klein berg,  1999)  or Google s PageRank(  Br in and Page,  1998)  have been successfully used in citation analysis,  social networks,  and the analysis of the link structure of the World Wide Web. 
In short,  agraphbased ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph,  by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph,  rather than relying only on local vertexspeci c information. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Indeed,  if we discourse analyze the sample text based on the RST Theory. 
Similarly to the other deep based work,  our system can also produce various summaries for the same source text,  for distinct strategies may be corresponding to varied choices of information units or discourse relations. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
The second uses latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
In this article,  a sentence based abstraction technique for information extraction is presented. 
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
An abs tractive summarization method consists of understanding the original text and retelling it in fewer words. 
attempts to develop an understanding of the main concepts in a document and then express those concepts in clear natural language. 
It uses linguistic methods to examine and interpret the text and then to find the new concepts and expressions to best describe it by generating a new shorter text that conveys the most important information from the original text document. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
the type of statistical information extracted,  the representation chosen for the extracted information,  the method of similarity calculation. 
The AutoSummENG method for summarization evaluation is a promising method based on language neutral analysis of texts and comparison to gold standard summaries. 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Subjective opinions are often critical in many conversations. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
We explored the email thread summarization problem using messages from the Enron corpus,  which consists of approximately half a million emails from the folders of 151 Enron employees. 
Previous work has employed a corpus of emails sent among the board members of the ACM chapter at Columbia University(  Ram bow,  Shrestha,  Chen,  & Lauridsen,  2004). 
Unlike news wire text,  which is meant for general consumption by a wide audience,  emails are only intended for their recipients. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
In (Chan 2006):
In fact,  the perception of cohesion is the result of a complex problem solving process in which the reader infers relations among the lexical items and events that are described in the text. 
Although some serious large scale research efforts in information extraction(  IE)  have gradually and systematically increased the complexity of the input texts and tried to understand some narrow topics,  one of the major limitations to current IE systems is that the template slots and their associated filling criteria must be anticipated and encoded. 
The Meeting Browser that was developed at Carnegie Mellon University allows users to review and browse the content of meetings based on automatic textual summarization. 
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
The different attempts in this field have shown that human quality text summarization was very complex since it encompasses discourse understanding,  abstraction,  and language generation(  Spar ck,  1993). 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (0017):
We propose a new unsupervised method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF)  to select sentences for automatic generic document summarization. 
Asa result,  LSArelated methods of document summarization may fail to extract meaningful sentences(  Lee & Seung,  1999; Zha,  2002)  In this paper,  we propose a new unsupervised generic document summarization method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF). 
While generic summarization distills the summarized text and presents the important semantic content of given documents,  query based summarization presents the summaries that are closely related to the query(  Mar cu,  1999; Mani & May bury,  1999; Mani,  2001)  Generally,  a document is comprised of major and minor topics. 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
This approach is based on the ICSI text summarization system(  Gil lick et al,  2008; Gil lick and Favre,  2009)  and was mo di ed for the fort he meeting domain in(  Gil lick et al,  2009)  . While most MMR implementations rely on words and their frequency throughout the data,  we could already show that using key phrases instead of words to model relevancy leads to better performance for meeting summarization(  Riedhammer et al,  a). 
Using key phrases to model relevance,  redundancy and concepts has already shown to outperform previous word based models(  Riedhammer et al,  a Gil lick et al,  2009)  and also provides a common ground for a fair comparison of sentence and concept based summarization models. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
We demonstrate structured DPPs on a toy geographical paths problem,  a still image multiple pose estimation task,  and two high dimensional text threading tasks. 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
4.11-tSummarization of documents through a progressive technique for selection of sentences
4.12-tEvaluation of sentence scoring methods for extractive summarization of text
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
We analyze and compare two di erent methods for unsupervised extractive spontaneous speech summarization in the meeting domain. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
For example,  while summarizing broadcast news is very similar to the summarization of textual documents,  conversations are much less structured and involve the interaction between multiple speakers Approachesforspeech summarization are mostly extractive and result in a selection of sentences from the input utterances. 
In (Ferreira et-al. 2013):
Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
Hence,  there is a need for novel graph based summarizers that also consider the correlations among multiple terms and the differences between positive and negative term correlations. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2012):
However,  previous approaches typically focus on single word significance while do not effectively capture correlations among multiple words at the same time. 
proposed to represent correlations among sentences by means of a graph based model. 
Frequent item set items et mining is a well established data mining technique to discover correlations among data. 
4.14-tIncorporating various levels of language analysis for tackling redundancy in text summarization
4.15-tEvolutionary optimization algorithm for summarizing multiple documents
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005). 
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
To solve the optimization problem has been created an improved differential evolution algorithm. 
4.16-tSummarization of multiple documents using a hybrid machine learning model
4.17-tImproving clustering at sentence-level with the help of ranking-based technique for theme-based summarization
In (Yang et-al. 2014):
Sentence clustering plays a pivotal role in theme based summarization,  which discovers topic themes defined as the clusters of highly related sentences in order to avoid redundancy and cover more diverse information. 
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters. 
Ranking based clustering Sentence clustering Theme based summarization. 
Thus,  good sentence clusters are the guarantee of good summaries in theme based summarization. 
Recall that our goal is to obtain more accurate sentence clusters and generate good summaries in theme based summarization. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
We first discuss a total of six different sentence extraction methods(  EM1– EM6)  which correspond to the four baseline topic representation techniques(  TR1–TR4) ,  introduced in Section 2,  plus the two topic theme based representations based on TR5 introduced in Section 3.16 For ease of exposition,  we will refer to the graph based theme representation as TH1 and the linked list based theme representation as TH2. 
Second,  we believe that our results represent a comprehensive and replicable study,  which demonstrates the effectiveness of a structured,  theme based approach to multi document summarization. 
We believe that these results prove the benefits of using the theme based topic representation for multi document summarization. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
Wang et al  (  2008)  proposed a framework based on sentence level semantic analysis and symmetric NMF(  nonnegative matrix factorization). 
They applied proposed approach to document clustering,  summarization,  and visualization. 
Supervised summarizations are regarded as two class classification problem at sentence level,  where the sentences in summary are positive samples,  and the non summary sentences are negative samples(  Cha li and Has an,  2011,  Song et al,  2011). 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
With the number of documents describing real world events and event oriented information needs rapidly growing on a daily basis,  the need for efficient retrieval and concise presentation of event related information is becoming apparent. 
In TDT,  the clustering of news stories and the detection of stories describing new events mostly rely on the traditional vector space model(  Salton et al,  1975) ,  which represents documents as vectors of words and uses the cosine between the vectors as a measure of document similarity. 
We believe that improving the extraction of temporal relations between events would yield further performance improvements in event centered retrieval and summarization. 
In (Aliguliyev 2009):
The article Fung and Ngai(  2006)  presents a multi document,  multilingual,  theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion(  story flow). 
The technology of automatic document summarization is maturing and may provide a solution to the information overload problem. 
Supervised extractive summarization techniques treat the summarization task as a two class classification problem at the sentence level,  where the summary sentences are positive samples while the non summary sentences are negative samples. 
4.18-tStatistical and linguistic based summarization system for multiple documents

Linguistic(  Syntactic)  based approach and Semantic based approach. 
Moreover,  this method could not handle or capture the information about similarities and differences across multiple documents. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
In our work,  we have considered both, (  1)  component based evaluations,  which evaluated each phase in the creation of a multi document summary separately,  and(  2)  intrinsic evaluations,  which evaluate the quality of each individual multi document summary generated by a summarization system. 
Now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust multi document summarization(  MDS)  systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary. 
In this article,  we perform what we believe to be the first comprehensive evaluation of the impact that different topic representation techniques have on the performance of a multi document summarization system. 
4.19-tMulti-document summarization based information retrieval using event graphs
4.20-textractive summarization of single documents through genetic operators and guided local search
4.21-t Topic-aspect based summarization through selection of groups
In (Fang et-al. 2015):
As a result,  controls the selection of groups of,  as well as the groups of features,  which represents the preferred aspects in our summarization task. 
With the construction of feature groups,  a latent variable is utilized to control the selection of them. 
Many extraction based summarization methods have been proposed in the past years. 
Experiment results on DUC2003 and DUC2004 data sets for text summarization and NUSWide data set for image summarization demonstrate that the introduction of group selection can indeed improve summary performance. 
In (Li et-al. 2013):
In this Int his paper we adopt the sentence compression sentence selection pipeline approach for compressive summarization,  but propose to perform toper form summary guided compression,  rather than generic sentence based compression. 
c 2013 Association for Computational Linguisticsmary guided compression combined with ILPbasedsentence selection for summarization in this paper We create a compression corpus for this purpose Using human summaries for a set of documents,  we identify salient words in the sentences. 
In this paper,  we propose a pipeline summarization approach that combines a novel guided compression model with ILPbased summary sentence selection sentences election. 
4.22-tSummarization of multiple documents based on social Folksonomy by analyzing semantically
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
In this paper,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system,  called FoDoSu(  Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization) ,  that employs the tag clusters used in Folksonomy systems to detect key sentences in multiple documents.

4.23-tOther text summarization approaches
4.23.1-tLearning-based approach for summarizing related sentences
4.23.2-tSemantic role labeling with minimal resources
In (Khan et-al. 2015):
In this framework,  contents of the source documents are represented by predicate argument structures by employing semantic role labeling. 
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. 
Our work,  in contrast,  aims to treat this limitation by using semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique to build semantic representation from the document text automatically. 
To the best of our knowledge,  semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique,  which exploits semantic role parser,  has not been employed for the semantic representation oftextin multi document abs tractive summarization. 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Second,  by restricting it to a small number of generic argument types,  we make the extraction more robust,  avoiding the performance issues typically associated with fine grained semantic role labeling approaches. 
The extraction performance for all types except LOCATION is satisfactory(  and,  though not directly comparable,  is above the 70% F score typical for semantic role labeling systems). 
They employ a semantic parser that uses dependencies from PropBank(  Kings bury & Palmer,  2002)  and they demonstrate that ranking based on semantic roles outperforms ranking based on syntactic dependencies. 
4.23.3-tSummarizing single documents through nested tree structure
4.23.4-tTwo-level sparse representation model for summarization of multiple documents
In (Liu et-al. 2015):
Based on the data reconstruction and sentence de noising assumption,  we present a twolevelsparse representation model to depict the process ofmultidocument summarization. 
Similar to(  Yang et al   2013) ,  the two level sparse representation model we introduced is NPhard,  we use simulated annealing algorithm to get the summarization To our knowledge,  this is the rst paper that utilizes cover. 
We design a two level sparse representation model to extract multi document summarization The original document set is sparsely represented by summary sentences. 
In (Yang et-al. 2013):
We have leveraged the dictionary learning for sparse representation model to construct the summary and to represent the image. 
We have discovered that the image collection summarization problem can be interpreted straightforwardly with the dictionary learning for sparse representation model under the SIFT BoW framework. 
We have explicitly reformulated the problem of automatic image summarization by using an sparse representation model and the simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization function more effectively. 
In (Li et-al. 2015a):
Second,  to estimate the importance of the oft he bi grams big rams,  in addition to the internal features based on the test documents(  e g,  document frequency,  bi gram big ram positions) ,  we propose to extract features by leveraging multiple external resources(  such as word embedding from additional corpus,  Wikipedia,  Dbpedia,  WordNet,  SentiWordNet). 
identifying important summary sentences from one or multiple documents. 
Given the recent success of the continuous representation for words,  we propose to use an unsupervised method to induce dense real valued low dimensional word embedding,  and then use the inner product as ameasure of semantic similarity between two strings In the word embedding model,  every word can be represented by a vector w We define the similarity between two sequences S = x 1,  x 2,  x k and sequence S = y 1,  y 2,  y l as the average pairwise similarity between any two words in them. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents.

In this paper,  we propose a framework that will automatically fuse similar information across multiple documents and use language generation to produce a concise abs tractive summary. 
was proposed for Chinese news summarization to model uncertain information and hence can better describe the domain knowledge. 
4.23.5-tSparse-coding based reader-aware summarization system for multiple documents
In (Wang and Li 2012):
Experimental results on DUC2002 and DUC2004 data sets demonstrate the performance improvement by aggregating multiple summarization systems,  and our proposed weighted consensus summarization method outperforms other combination methods.

Previous research has shown that ensemble methods,  by combining multiple input systems,  are a popular way to overcome instability and increase performance in many machine learning tasks,  such as classification,  clustering and ranking. 
4.23.6-tSummarization of multiple documents through recursive neural networks based ranking approach
In (Cao et-al. 2015a):
We develop a Ranking framework upon Recursive Neural Networks(  R2N2)  to rank sentences for multi document summarization. 
In addition,  recursive neural networks are used to automatically learn ranking features over the tree,  with handcrafted feature vectors of words as inputs. 
In this parsing tree,  recursive neural networks measure the importance of all these non terminal nodes. 
4.23.7-tGraph-based extractive summarization by considering importance, non-redundancy and coherence
In (Parveen and Strube 2015):
We propose a graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization which considers importance,  non redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. 
Therefore,  in our work,  computing importance,  non redundancy and coherence is tightly integrated and taken care of simultaneously Our graph based summarization technique has the further advantage of being completely unsupervised We apply our graph based summarization technique to scienti c articles from the journal PLOS Medicine,  a high impact open access journal from the medical domain. 
Hence,  we optimize importance,  non redundancy and coherence simultaneously. 
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
These include responsiveness measures such as ROUGE(  Lin & Och,  2004) ,  Pyramid(  Passonneau,  Nenkova,  McKeown,  & Sigelman,  2005) ,  Basic Elements(  Hovy,  Lin,  & Zhou,  2005) ,  correlation(  Dang,  2005)  ; readability measures such as grammaticality,  non redundancy,  referential clarity,  focus,  as well as structure and coherence(  Dang,  2005). 
In both extractive and abs tractive summarization,  a key consideration is how to properly represent the knowledge contained in the input document. 
In this paper,  we review and detail our approach to automatic,  multi document extractive summarization. 
4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Several real world machine learning applications involve hierarchy based categorization of topics for a set of objects. 
Given a collection of articles spanning different topics,  but with similar titles,  automatically generate a disambiguation page for those titles using the Wikipedia category hierarchy as a topic DAG. 
Let G(  V,  E)  be the DAG structured topic hierarchy with V topics. 
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,  increasing the quality of the updates. 
Our system predicts sentence salience in the context of a large scale event,  such as a disaster,  and integrates these predictions into a clustering based multi document summarization system. 
While we evaluate these features in the domain of disasters,  this approach is generally applicable to many update summarization tasks. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
For instance,  in Figure a weak pose detector favors large clusters of poses that are nearly identical,  but lteringthrough a DPP ensures that the nal predictions are well separated Throughout this survey we demonstrate applications for DPPs in a variety of settings,  including. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The goal of learning is to choose appropriate θ based on the training sample so that we can make accurate predictions on unseen inputs While there are a variety of ob jective functions commonly used for learning,  here we will focus on maximum likelihood learning(  or maximum likelihood estimation,  often abbreviatedMLE) ,  where the goal is to choose θ to maximize the conditional log likelihood of the Optimizing L is consistent under mild assumptions that is,  if the training data are actually drawn from a conditional DPP with parameter θ∗,  then the learned θ → θ∗ as T → Of course real data are unlikely to exactly follow any particular model,  but in any case reasonable probability estimates,  since maximizing L can be seen as minimizing the loglossthe maximum likelihood approach has the advantage of calibrating the DPP to produce on the training data To optimize the log likelihood,  we will use standard algorithms such as gradient ascent or LBFGS Nocedal,  1980. 
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
Conventional IR systems find and rank documents based on maximizing relevance to the user query(  Salton,  1970; van Rijsbergen,  1979; Buckley,  1985; Salton,  1989). 
Consider the situation where the user issues a search query,  for instance on a news topic,  and the retrieval system finds hundreds of closely ranked documents in response. 
4.23.12-tPhrase-based compressive cross-language summarization
4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In (Graham 2015):
An analysis of evaluation of summarization metrics was provided with an evaluation of BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE. 
In total,  therefore,  when employing ROUGE for the evaluation of summarization systems,  there are 192(  8 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2)  possible system level variants to choose from. 
We subsequently replicate a recent large scale evaluation that relied on,  what we now know to be,  suboptimal ROUGE variants revealing distinct conclusions about the relative performance of stateoftheart summarization systems. 
Our evaluation reveals for the first time which metric variants significantly outperform others,  optimal metric variants distinct from current recommended best variants,  as well as machine translation metric BLEU to have performance on par with ROUGE for the purpose of evaluation of summarization systems. 
In (Lin 2004):
In this paper,  we introduced ROUGE,  an automatic evaluation package for summarization,  and conducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic measures included in the ROUGE package using three years of DUC data. 
We found that(  1)  ROUGE2,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  and ROUGES worked well in single document summarization tasks, (  2)  ROUGE1,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 performed great in evalua ting very short summaries(  or headline like summaries) , (  3)  correlation of high 90% was hard to achieve for multi document summarization tasks but ROUGE1,  ROUGE2,  ROUGES4,  ROUGES9,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 worked reasonably well when stop words were exc luded from match ing, (  4)  exclusion of stop words usually improved correlation,  and(  5)  correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references. 
Therefore,  how to evaluate summaries automatically has drawn a lot of at tent ion in the summarization research community in recent years. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
Although this is generally accepted in the summarization literature,  and Rouge scores are widely reported in lieu of opinions from human assessors,  the extension of this automatic metric across domains has not been established. 
This represents among the first automatic summarization work of its type on this particular corpus As a first step,  we have adapted existing document summarization techniques to tackle this problem. 
We explored the email thread summarization problem using messages from the Enron corpus,  which consists of approximately half a million emails from the folders of 151 Enron employees. 
4.24-tPro and Cons
5-tComparison of recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In (CR100):
This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
Moreover,  in order to decide which of the new sentences should be included in the abs tractive summary,  an extractive text summarization approach is developed(  i e,  COMPENDIUM) ,  so that the most relevant abs tractive sentence scan sentences can be selected and extracted. 
In light of this,  Text Summarization(  TS)  is of great help since its main aim is to produce a condensed new text containing a significant portion of the information in the original text(  s)  The process of summarization can be divided into three stages. 
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
This paper presents a method for text summarization based on the gist of a source text that differs from the related ones in Computational Linguistics. 
Those are added to the extract provided that they satisfy summarization requirements,  namely,  gist preservation,  textuality,  relevance,  and compression constraints. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
This paper proposes two approaches to address text summarization. 
Table 1 shows the outputs of our approaches in different phases of the text summarization process. 
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels.

According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
Knowledge poor approaches do not consider any knowledge pertaining to the domain to which text summarization is applied therefore,  knowledge poor approaches can be easily applied to any domain(  Abracos & Lopes,  1997; Gong & Liu,  2001; Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; May eng & Jang,  1999; Salton et al,  1997; Mitra,  Singh al,  & Buckley,  1997). 
8-tSummary evaluation
8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Patel et-al. 2007):
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e. 
So,  evaluation in terms of informativeness is usually preferred. 
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
Degree of Evaluation has been debatable for long time. 
Section gives details of material and evaluation strategies used. 
This paper describes an efficient algorithm for language independent generic extractive summarization for single document. 
In (Banerjee et-al. 2015):
Further,  manual evaluation by human judges shows that our technique produces summaries with acceptable linguistic quality and high informativeness. 
In manual evaluation,  our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and readability. 
Table 2 shows the results obtained by manual evaluation. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
The evaluation setup and comparative results regarding informativeness scores are presented and discussed in Section 4. 
We have described the use of complex networks concepts for extractive summarization,  as well as its evaluation through standard informativeness scores and significance tests. 
This type of analysis depends only on the corpus employed,  not on a fixed compression rate or specific informativeness score. 
8.2-tQuality evaluation9-tEvaluation results
8.3-tAsiya, an evaluation toolkit
In (He et-al. 2012):
We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence. 
Due to limited space,  more information can be referred to the toolkit package. 
Table 1 and Table 2 show the ROUGE evaluation results on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 data sets respectively. 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
Fo reach For each article,  TextRank generates an words summary the task undertaken by other systems participating in this single document summarization task For evaluation,  we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit,  which is a method based on Ngramstatistics,  found to be highly correlated with human evaluations(  Lin and Hovy,  2003). 
The sentences with the highest rank are selected for inclusion in the abstract For this sample article,  the sentences with ids 9,  15,  16,  18 are extracted,  resulting in a summary of about words,  which according to automatic evaluation measures,  is ranked the second among summaries produced by 15 other systems(  see Section 4.2 fo revaluation for evaluation fore valuation methodology). 
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
In (Wang and Li 2012):
We use ROUGE(  Lin & Hovy,  2003)  toolkit(  version 1.5.5)  to measure the summarization performance,  which is widely applied by DUC for performance evaluation. 
To evaluate the summarization results empirically,  we use the DUC2002 and DUC2004 data sets,  both of which are open benchmark data sets from Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  for generic automatic summarization evaluation. 
Multi document summarization is a fundamental tool for document understanding and has received much attention recently. 
8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
This is a welcome volume for both researchers and teachers who are interested in extending the traditional boundaries of Information Retrieval to include related information access and analytic applications such as summarization,  extraction,  and question answering Text summarization,  which is de ned by the editors as the process of distilling the most important information from a source(  s)  to produce an abridged version for a particular user(  s)  and task(  s)  ” is a technology that has been worked on for more than forty years anda capability that users have long desired. 
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting. 
Classical Approaches CorpusBased Approaches Exploiting DiscourseStructure; KnowledgeRich Approaches Evaluation Methods,  and New SummarizationProblem Areas.Following the general introduction is an excellent piece by Karen Spar ck Jones that provides a framework for understanding the task of summarization and calls for a doable research strategy that should serve to provide useful technology in the near future using what is already known in NLP. 
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
In order to make our experiments more relevant,  we have used the evaluation thee valuation framework of a large scale project for evaluating text summarization algorithms. 
“ Text summarization is still an emerging field,  and serious questions remain concerning the appropriate methods and types of evaluation.
