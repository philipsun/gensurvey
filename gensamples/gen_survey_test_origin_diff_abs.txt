Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In  Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005: 
We present eight different methods of generating multi document summaries and evaluate each of these methods on a large set of topics used in past DUC workshops
Our evaluation results show a significant improvement in the quality of summaries based on topic themes over MDS methods that use other alternative topic representations
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In  Zajic et-al. 2008: 
We demonstrate these ideas on the Enron email collection – a very challenging corpus because of the highly technical language
Both approaches are implemented in our general framework driven by sentence compression
In  Fattah and Ren 2009: 
This approach is a trainable summarizer,  which takes into account several features,  including sentence position,  positive keyword,  negative keyword,  sentence centrality,  sentence resemblance to the title,  sentence inclusion of name entity,  sentence inclusion of numerical data,  sentence relative length,  Bushy path of the sentence and aggregated similarity for each sentence to generate summaries
Moreover,  we use all feature parameters to train feed forward neural network   FFNN  ,  probabilistic neural network   PNN   and Gaussian mixture model   GMM   in order to construct a text summarizer for each model
The results of the proposed approach are promising,  especially the GMM approach
In  Sarkar 2010: 
Multi document summaries can enable the users to identify the main theme   central idea   of a cluster of texts very rapidly
For our experiments,  we develop   1   a primary summarization system,  which extracts sentences to form a draft summary and   2   a trimming component,  which accepts a draft summary for revision
Our test results on DUC 2004 data set show that the summarization system,  which integrates both the extraction component and the trimming component,  performs better than some stateofthe art summarization approaches
In  Dunlavy et-al. 2007: 
Under this framework,  we then demonstrate that the QCS system   endtoend   achieves performance as good as or better than the best summarization engines
Given a query,  QCS retrieves relevant documents,  separates the retrieved documents into topic clusters,  and creates a single summary for each cluster
Our system demonstrates the feasibility of assembling an effective IR system from existing software libraries,  the usefulness of the modularity of the design,  and the value of this particular combination of modules
Most importantly,  the combination of the three types of methods in the QCS design improves retrievals by providing users more focused information organized by topic
Information retrieval systems consist of many complicated components
In  Riedhammer et-al. 2010: 
Both optimization problems are formulated as an integer linear program   ILP   and solved using public domain software

In  Song et-al. 2011: 
This paper proposes a fuzzy evolutionary optimization modeling   FEOM   and its applications to unsupervised categorization and extractive summarization
The searching capability of FEOM is exploited to explore appropriate partitions of documents such that the similarity metric of the resulting clusters is optimized
As a portable,  modular and extensively executable model,  FEOM is firstly implemented for clustering text documents

3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In  Fattah and Ren 2009: 
Furthermore,  we use trained models by one language to test summarization performance in the other language
The proposed approach performance is measured at several compression rates on a data corpus composed of 100 Arabic political articles and 100 English religious articles
The results of the proposed approach are promising,  especially the GMM approach
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In  Hearst 1997: 
Multi paragraph Multipara graph subtopic segmentation should be useful for many text analysis tasks,  including information retrieval and summarization
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In  Baralis et-al. 2013: 
The graph nodes,  which represent combinations of two or more terms,  are first ranked by means of a PageRank strategy that discriminates between positive and negative term correlations
Then,  the produced node ranking is used to drive the sentence selection process
The experiments performed on benchmark and real life documents demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to many stateoftheart summarizers
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In  Fattah and Ren 2009: 
Furthermore,  we use trained models by one language to test summarization performance in the other language
Moreover,  we use all feature parameters to train feed forward neural network   FFNN  ,  probabilistic neural network   PNN   and Gaussian mixture model   GMM   in order to construct a text summarizer for each model
The results of the proposed approach are promising,  especially the GMM approach
In  Yang et-al. 2014: 
As the length of sentences is short and the content it contains is limited,  the bagofwords cosine similarity traditionally used for document clustering is no longer reasonably suitable
Special treatment for measuring sentence similarity is necessary
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In  Yeh et-al. 2005: 
We evaluate LSA + T.R.M both with single documents and at the corpus level to investigate the competence of LSA in text summarization
The two novel approaches were measured at several compression rates on a data corpus composed of 100 political articles
When the compression rate was 30%,  an average fmeasure of 49% for MCBA,  52% for MCBA + GA,  44% and 40% for LSA + T.R.M in single document and corpus level were achieved respectively
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In  Chan 2006: 
Instead,  the attention is focused on the identification of the main factors in the textual continuity
Simulation experiments suggest that this technique is useful because it moves away from a purely keyword based method of textual information extraction and its associated limitations
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In  Ye et-al. 2007: 
The local topics will specify the promising subspaces related to the selected concepts and sentences
Based on this lattice,  the summary is an optimized selection of a set of distinct and salient local topics that lead to maximal coverage of concepts with the given number of sentences
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In  Ko and Seo 2004: 
We here propose a new automatic text categorization method for learning from only unlabeled data using a bootstrapping framework and a feature projection technique
From results of our experiments,  our method showed reasonably comparable performance compared with a supervised method
If our method is used in a text categorization task,  building text categorization systems will become significantly faster and less expensive
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In  Carenini et-al. 2008: 
In this paper,  we study the problem of summarizing email conversations
The empirical evaluation shows that the basic clue words have the highest accuracy among the three cohesion measures
Moreover,  subjective words can significantly improve accuracy
In  Kim and Hovy 2005: 
We describe a sentence level opinion detection system
MPQA data,  an internal corpus,  and the TREC- 2003 Novelty track data
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In  Antiqueira et-al. 2009: 
An additional summarizer was created which selects the highest ranked sentences in the 14 systems,  as in a voting system
When applied to a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese texts,  some CNSumm versions performed better than summarizers that do not employ deep linguistic knowledge,  with results comparable to stateoftheart summarizers based on expensive linguistic resources
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In  Fattah and Ren 2009: 
Furthermore,  we use trained models by one language to test summarization performance in the other language
The proposed approach performance is measured at several compression rates on a data corpus composed of 100 Arabic political articles and 100 English religious articles
The results of the proposed approach are promising,  especially the GMM approach
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In  Carbonell and Goldstein 1998: 
The latter are borne out by the recent results of the SUMMAC conference in the evaluation of summarization systems
However,  the clearest advantage is demonstrated in constructing non redundant multi document summaries,  where MMR results are clearly superior to nonMMR passage selection
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In  Alguliev et-al. 2011: 
The proposed model is quite general and can also be used for single and multi document summarization
We implemented our model on multi document summarization task
Experimental results on DUC2005 and DUC2007 data sets showed that our proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems
4.11-tSummarization of documents through a progressive technique for selection of sentences
4.12-tEvaluation of sentence scoring methods for extractive summarization of text
In  Ferreira et-al. 2013: 
It is an important way of finding relevant information in large text libraries or in the Internet
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive
Three different data sets   News,  Blogs and Article contexts   were evaluated
In  Lin 2004: 
ROUGE stands for RecallOriented Unde rstudy for Gi sting Evaluation
This paper introduces four different ROUGE measures
In  Fattah and Ren 2009: 
The results of the proposed approach are promising,  especially the GMM approach
Then we use all features in combination to train genetic algorithm   GA   and mathematical regression   MR   models to obtain a suitable combination of feature weights
Moreover,  we use all feature parameters to train feed forward neural network   FFNN  ,  probabilistic neural network   PNN   and Gaussian mixture model   GMM   in order to construct a text summarizer for each model
In  Gupta et-al. 2011: 
As per the limitations of the current summarizing systems,  the summary generated by those systems contains poorly linked sentences and are not topically salient
Our results show that the agreement among the human subjects and our algorithm is highly significant
A threshold angle between the two vectors is predefined experimentally to which the ranked scored sentences to be dropped and which the significant sentences with ranking scores higher than threshold to be extracted
We then identified and extracted high scored sentences and then the Vector Space approach is used to measure the relatedness similarity between the extracted sentence and the topic words involving again the WordNet lexical database relationships to prioritise the topically related sentences
Our research work presents the concept of topic word similarity with the high ranking sentences obtained after applying various heuristics,  lexical chaining and the Vector Space approaches
In  Barrera and Verma 2012: 
These results have implications not only for extractive and abs tractive single document summarization,  but could also be leveraged in multi document summarization
This approach essentially combines syntactic,  semantic,  and statistical methodologies,  and reflects psychological findings that pinpoint specific selection patterns as humans construct summaries
In  Nobata et-al. 2001: 
Results from the TSC formal run showed that our method was effective in the sentence extraction task
In  Mihalcea and Tarau 2004: 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In  Baralis et-al. 2013: 
It discovers and exploits association rules to represent the correlations among multiple terms that have been neglected by previous approaches
This paper presents a novel and general purpose graph based summarizer,  namely GraphSum   Graph based Summarizer
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis
In  Brin and Page 1998: 
Furthermore,  due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation,  creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago
To engineer a search engine is a challenging task
Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want
Despite the importance of large scale search engines on the Web,  very little academic research has been done on them
They answer tens of millions of queries every day
4.14-tIncorporating various levels of language analysis for tackling redundancy in text summarization
4.15-tEvolutionary optimization algorithm for summarizing multiple documents
In  Alguliev et-al. 2013: 
We implemented the proposed model on multi document summarization task
Experiments have been performed on DUC2002 and DUC2004 data sets
The experimental results provide strong evidence that the proposed optimization based approach is a viable method for document summarization
4.16-tSummarization of multiple documents using a hybrid machine learning model
4.17-tImproving clustering at sentence-level with the help of ranking-based technique for theme-based summarization
In  Yang et-al. 2014: 
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters
The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by both the cluster quality analysis and the summarization evaluation conducted on the DUC 2004 and DUC2007 data sets
4.18-tStatistical and linguistic based summarization system for multiple documents
In  Ferreira et-al. 2014: 
The massive quantity of data available today in the Internet has reached such a huge volume that it has become humanly unfeasible to efficiently sieve useful information from it
Such a purpose is achieved through a new sentence clustering algorithm based on a graph model that makes use of statistic similarities and linguistic treatment
In  Ferreira et-al. 2013: 
In addition,  directions to improve the sentence extraction results obtained are suggested
Abs tractive summaries attempt to improve the coherence among sentences by eliminating redundancies and clarifying the contest of sentences
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive
Three different data sets   News,  Blogs and Article contexts   were evaluated
In  Mihalcea and Tarau 2004: 
4.19-tMulti-document summarization based information retrieval using event graphs
4.20-textractive summarization of single documents through genetic operators and guided local search
4.21-t Topic-aspect based summarization through selection of groups
In  Fang et-al. 2015: 
We compare our proposed approach with some stateoftheart methods on DUC2003,  DUC2004 data sets for text summarization and NUSWide data set for image summarization
The results show our method can generate meaningful summarization in terms of ROUGE and Jensen–Shannon Divergence metrics
4.22-tSummarization of multiple documents based on social Folksonomy by analyzing semantically
In  Heu et-al. 2015: 
Then,  by exploiting tag clusters,  we analyze the semantic relationships between words in the word frequency table
Finally,  we create a summary of multiple documents by analyzing the importance of each word and its semantic relatedness to others
Experimental results from the TAC 2008 and 2009 data sets demonstrate the improvement of our proposed framework over existing summarization systems
4.23-tOther text summarization approaches
4.23.1-tLearning-based approach for summarizing related sentences
4.23.2-tSemantic role labeling with minimal resources
In  Kaljahi et-al. 2014: 
Moreover,  there seems to be no improvement gained from projecting semantic roles between direct translations than between indirect translations
4.23.3-tSummarizing single documents through nested tree structure
4.23.4-tTwo-level sparse representation model for summarization of multiple documents
In  Liu et-al. 2015: 
Coverage,  Sparsity and Diversity
We then for
malize the task of multi document summarization as an optimization problem according to the above properties,  and use simulated annealing algorithm to solve it
Extensive experiments on summarization benchmark data sets DUC2006 and DUC2007 show that our proposed model is effective and outperforms the stateoftheartalgorithms
4.23.5-tSparse-coding based reader-aware summarization system for multiple documents
In  Li et-al. 2015a: 
The core idea of this summarization method is to select the summary sentences by maximizing the sum of the weights of the language concepts that appear in the summary
Bi grams Big rams are often used as these language concepts because Gil lick et al     2009   stated that the bi grams big rams gave consistently better performance than uni grams or trigrams for avariety of ROUGE measures
The association between the language concepts and sentences serves as the constraints
This ILP method is formally represented as below   see   Gil lick et al,  2009   for more details
Some stateoftheart summarization systems use integer linear programming   ILP   based methods that aim to maximize the important concepts covered in the summary
These concepts are often obtained by selecting bigramsfrom the documents
In this paper,  we improve such bi gram big ram based ILP summarization methods from different aspects
4.23.6-tSummarization of multiple documents through recursive neural networks based ranking approach
In  Cao et-al. 2015a: 
Hierarchical regressions are then conducted with learned features concatenating raw features
Ranking scores of sentences and words are utilized to effectively select informative and non redundant sentences to generate summaries
Experiments on the DUC 2001,  2002 and 2004 multi document summarization data sets show that R2N2 outperforms stateoftheart extractive summarization approaches
4.23.7-tGraph-based extractive summarization by considering importance, non-redundancy and coherence
In  Parveen and Strube 2015: 
We compare ROUGE scores and human judgements for coherence of different systems on scienti c articles
Our method performs considerably better than other systems on this data
Also,  our graphbasedsummarization technique achieves stateoftheartresults on DUC 2002 data
Incorporating our local coherence measure always achieves the best results
4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In  Bairi et-al. 2015: 
We use a large margin framework to learn convex mixtures over the set of sub modular components
We empirically evaluate our method on the problem of automatically generating Wikipedia disambiguation pages using human generated clusterings as ground truth
We find that our framework improves upon several baselines according to a variety of standard evaluation metrics including the Jaccard Index,  F score and NMI,  and moreover,  can be scaled to extremely large scale problems
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In  Kedzie et-al. 2015: 
We use novel,  disaster specific features for salience prediction,  including geolocations and language models representing the language of disaster
Our evaluation on a standard set of retrospective events using ROUGE shows that salience prediction provides a significant improvement over other approaches
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In  Hong et-al. 2015: 
The model relies on a rich set of features that capture content importance from different perspectives
Our model performs better than the systems that we combined based on manual and automatic evaluations
We also achieve very competitive performance on six DUC/TAC data sets,  comparable to the stateoftheart on most data sets
4.23.12-tPhrase-based compressive cross-language summarization
4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In  Graham 2015: 
Our evaluation reveals for the first time which metric variants significantly outperform others,  optimal metric variants distinct from current recommended best variants,  as well as machine translation metric BLEU to have performance on par with ROUGE for the purpose of evaluation of summarization systems
We subsequently replicate a recent large scale evaluation that relied on,  what we now know to be,  suboptimal ROUGE variants revealing distinct conclusions about the relative performance of stateoftheart summarization systems
4.24-tPro and Cons
5-tComparison of recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In  Ganesan et-al. 2010: 
The summaries are readable,  reasonably well formed and are informative enough to convey the major opinions
In  Kallimani et-al. 2011: 
The Internet provides many sources of different opinions,  expressed through user reviews of products,  blogs,  and forum discussions
Systems which could automatically summarize these opinions would be immensely useful for those who wish to use this information to make decisions
In  Khan et-al. 2015: 
Results indicate that the proposed approach performs better than other summarization systems
Experiment of this study is carried out using DUC2002,  a standard corpus for text summarization
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text
In  Banerjee et-al. 2015: 
Our ILP model represents the shortest paths as binary variables and considers the length of the path,  information score and linguistic quality score in the objective function
First,  our proposed approach identifies the most important document in the multi document set
In this work,  we aim at developing an abs tractive summarizer
In manual evaluation,  our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and readability
In  Bing et-al. 2015: 
Experimental results on the benchmark data set TAC 2011 show that our framework outperforms the stateoftheart models under automated pyramid evaluation metric,  and achieves reasonably well results on manual linguistic quality evaluation
We propose an abstraction based multi document summarization framework that can construct new sentences by exploring more fine grained syntactic units than sentences,  namely,  noun verb phrases
In  Rush et-al. 2015: 
Summarization based on text extraction is inherently limited,  but generation style abs tractive methods have proven challenging to build
The model shows significant performance gains on the DUC2004 shared task compared with several strong baselines
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization
In  Radev et-al. 2004a: 
In  Patel et-al. 2007: 
This paper describes an efficient algorithm for language independent generic extractive summarization for single document
Content richness,  Theme features,  Sentence reference index,  Partitioning,  Fuzzy summary,  Coherence,  Degree of representative ness
Key Words
In  Kabadjov et-al. 2010: 
In this paper we present NewsGist,  a multilingual,  multi document news summarization system underpinned by the Singular Value Decomposition   SVD   paradigm for document summarization and purpose built for the Europe Media Monitor   EMM
In  Gupta and Lehal 2010: 
It uses linguistic methods to examine and interpret the text and then to find the new concepts and expressions to best describe it by generating a new shorter text that conveys the most important information from the original text document
It is very difficult for human beings to manually summarize large documents of text
Text Summarization methods can be classified into extractive and abs tractive summarization
