Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Furthermore,  considering that numerous textual sources provide information about the same real world events,  the need for aggregating and summarizing the most relevant information has become obvious. 
We chose these particular kernels because their general forms have intuitive interpretations for event matching and can be easily adjusted to fit our needs for event centered text comparison. 
The proposed model is extractive(  summaries are built by extracting sentences from the original texts)  and non focused(  the summarization is not guided by a specific information need). 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
For instance,  the parts could be positions ona context free grammar,  and then an element of Y might be a complete parse of a sentence This assumption of structure will give us the algorithmic leverage we need to e ciently work with a distribution over a doubly exponential number of possibilities Because elements of Y are now structures,  we will no longer think of Y = {1,  2,. 
(  Perhaps we think students tend to spread out)  In this context each meeting of the class is a new sample from the empirical distribution over subsets of the(  xed)  seats,  so we merely need to collect enough samples and we should be able to t our model,  as desired For many problems,  however,  the notion of a single xed base set Y is inadequate. 
This poses an extreme computational challenge In order to develop e cient structured DPPs(  SDPPs) ,  we will therefore need to combine the dynamic programming techniques used for standard structured prediction with the algorithms that make DPP inference e cient. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
This seemingly unreachable goal,  equivalent to machine reading,  can be limited to the extent that we only need INITs to be precise and accurate enough to generate a summary from them. 
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
According to Mani and May bury(  1999) ,  automatic text summarization takes a partially structured source text from multiple texts written about the same topic,  extracts information content from it,  and presents the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs. 
Thus,  now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust text summarization systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary(  Harabagiu and Lacatusu,  2010,  Yang and Wang,  2008). 
As compared to generic summarization that must contain the core information central to the source documents,  the main goal of query focused multi document summarization is to create from the documents a summary that can answer the need for information expressed in the topic or explain the topic. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Even though a series of numerous experiments has already been conducted,  we feel that the presented method should be further investigated as it may hold implications concerning the potential for using the graph representation in a language neutral way for various NLP tasks. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
In (0079):
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non discourse features(  Miltsakaki and Kukich,  2000). 
Coherent text is characterized by various types of cohesive links that facilitate text comprehension(  Halliday and Has an,  1976). 
The use of rare words or technical terminology for example can make text difficult to read for certain audience types(  CollinsThompson and Call an,  2004; Sch warm Schwa rm and Ostendorf,  2005; Elhadad and Sutaria,  2007). 
In (Carlson et-al. 2003):
Thus,  our approach contributes to the community quite differently from detailed analyses of specific discourse phenomena in depth,  such as anaphoric relations(  Gar side et al,  1997)  or style types(  Leech et al,  1997)  ; analysis of a single text from multiple perspectives(  Mann and Thompson,  1992)  ; or illustrations of a theoretical model on a single representative text(  Brit ton Britt on and Black,  1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch,  1983). 
While other discourse theoretical approaches posit distinctly different treatments for various levels of the discourse(  Van Dijk and Kintsch,  1983; Meyer,  1985) ,  RST relies on a standard methodology to analyze the document at all levels. 
Our team was able to reach a significant level of consistency,  even though they faced a number of challenges which reflect differences in the agreement scores at the various levels. 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Simpler approaches were then explored that consist of extracting representative text spans texts pans,  using statistical techniques and or techniques based on surface domain independent linguistic analyses. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Our approaches have been used the feature extraction criteria which gives researchers opportunity to use many varieties of these features based on the used language and the text type. 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
These categories of ngrams are based on statistical criteria and are used to describe how noise can deteriorate the performance of our method as a function of the methodology parameters. 
Therefore,  it would be interesting to hold only useful sub graphs based on a statistical measure of usefulness or nd an algorithmic alternative to our own. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
This technique allows users to easily understand a topic by looking at a short summary. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
We then identified and extracted high scored sentences and then the Vector Space approach is used to measure the relatedness similarity between the extracted sentence and the topic words involving again the WordNet lexical database relationships to prioritise the topically related sentences. 
Our research work presents the concept of topic word similarity with the high ranking sentences obtained after applying various heuristics,  lexical chaining and the Vector Space approaches. 
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Other information,  provided say by unsupervised approaches such as LDA and its variants,  can also be utilized by defining a sub modular function that expresses coherence between the chosen topics and this information. 
We study the problem of summarizing DAGstructured topic hierarchies over a given set of documents. 
Unlike previous work,  which focuses on clustering the set of documents using the topic hierarchy as features,  we directly pose the problem as a sub modular optimization problem on a topic hierarchy using the documents as features. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
In this article,  we present event graphs,  a novel event based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. 
To construct the event graphs,  we combine machine learning and rule based models to extract sentence level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. 
The information retrieval model measures the similarity between queries and documents by computing graph kernels over event graphs. 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
Graph based ranking algorithms like Klein berg s HITS algorithm(  Klein berg,  1999)  or Google s PageRank(  Br in and Page,  1998)  have been successfully used in citation analysis,  social networks,  and the analysis of the link structure of the World Wide Web. 
In this paper,  we introduce the TextRank graph based ranking model for graphs extracted from natural language texts. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
This paper presents a novel and general purpose graph based summarizer,  namely GraphSum(  Graph based Summarizer). 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
Query focused summarization Query expansion Graph based ranking. 
Wan et al  (  b)  proposed a graph based method for simultaneous text summarization and keyword extraction by using not only relationships between sentences,  but also relationships between words,  and relationships between words and sentences. 
In (Parveen and Strube 2015):
We propose a graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization which considers importance,  non redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. 
We rank sentences on the basis of importance by applying a graph based ranking algorithm to this graph and ensure nonredundancyand local coherence of the summary by means of an optimization step. 
Our graph based method is applied to scienti c articles from the journal PLOSMedicine. 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
This article presents a novel automatic method(  AutoSummENG)  for the evaluation of summa rization systems,  based on comparing the character ngram graphs representation of the extracted summaries and a number of model summaries. 
Given this,  we have evaluated different representation types based on both the type of represented data(  character or word ngrams)  as well as the use or luck of use of connectivity information between the data(  graph or histogram). 
Within this study,  we measure the effectiveness of different representation methods,  namely,  word and character ngram graph and histogram,  dif ferent ngram neighborhood indication methods as well as different comparison methods between the supplied representations. 
In (Ganesan et-al. 2010):
We present a novel graph based summarization framework(  Opinosis)  that generates concise abs tractive summaries of highly redundant opinions. 
Figure 1 shows a resulting OpinosisGraph based on four sentences. 
In this paper,  we propose a novel flexible summarization framework,  Opinosis,  that uses graphs to produce abs tractive summaries of highly redundant opinions. 
In (0067):
We consider the task of summarizing a cluster of related sentences with a short sentence which we call multi sentence compression and present a simple approach based on shortest paths in word graphs. 
• We present a simple and robust word graph based method of generating succinct compressions which requires as little as a part of speech tagger and a list of stop words. 
We begin by explaining the graph construction process and continue with the details of two compression methods. 
In (CR100):
Our aim is to explore to what extent new sentences generated employing a word graph based method(  which either compress or merge information)  are suitable for producing abstracts. 
However,  preliminary experiments carried out prove that the combination of extractive and abs tractive information is a more suitable strategy to adopt towards the generation of abstracts.KeywordsHuman Language Technologies,  automated retrieval and mining,  automated content summarization,  abs tractive techniques,  graph based algorithms. 
We first propose a method for compressing and merging information based on word graphs,  and then we generate summaries from the resulting sentences This allows us to quantify how feasible it is to produce abstracts directly. 
In (Otterbacher et-al. 2009):
We represent a text as a graph of passages linked based on their pairwise lexical similarity. 
LexRank isa random walk based method that was proposed for generic summarization Our contribution in this paper is to derive a graph based sentence ranking method by incorporating the query information into the original LexRankalgorithm,  which is query independent. 
We have presented a generic method for passage retrieval that is based on random walks on graphs. 
In (Boudin F, Morin E 2013):
As an alternative,  several word graph based approaches that only require a POS tagger were proposed. 
• We extend Filippova(  2010)  s word graph based. 
In this section,  we first describe Filippova(  2010)  s word graph based MSC approach. 
We extended Filippova(  2010)  s word graph based MSC approach by adding a rereranking step that favors compressions that contain the most relevant key phrases of the input sentence set. 
In (Moawad IF, Aref M 2012):
In this paper,  a novel approach is presented to create an abs tractive summary for a single document using a rich semantic graph reducing technique. 
This approach exploits a new semantic graph called Rich Semantic Graph(  RSG). 
In this paper,  a novel approach is presented to generate an abs tractive summary automatically for the input text using a semantic graph reducing technique. 
In (Banerjee et-al. 2015):
We proposed a novel ILP based technique to select the best shortest paths in a word graph to maximize information content and linguistic quality of a summary. 
Graph based techniques have also been very popular in summarization. 
employed a graph based approach to generate concise abs tractive summaries from highly redundant opinions. 
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
Second,  we use two graph based summarization approaches,  Generalized ClueWordSummarizer and PageRank,  to extract sentences as summaries. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
Cohesion is thus a surface indicator of the discourse structure of a document. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Sections 3 Modified corpus based approach,  4 LSA give a detail description of our proposed approaches. 
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Indeed,  if we discourse analyze the sample text based on the RST Theory. 
Similarly to the other deep based work,  our system can also produce various summaries for the same source text,  for distinct strategies may be corresponding to varied choices of information units or discourse relations. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
The second uses latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
In (0017):
In existing unsupervised methods,  Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  is used for sentence selection sentences election. 
Unsupervised methods do not require training data such as human made summaries to train the summarizer(  Nomoto & Yuji,  2001; Buckley & Walz,  1999; Gong & Liu,  2001)  Recently,  many generic document summarization methods using Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  have been proposed(  Gong & Liu,  2001; Li,  Li,  & Wu,  2006; Yeh et al,  2005; Zha,  2002). 
The second method uses a latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to semantically identify important sentences for summary creations. 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
In this article,  a sentence based abstraction technique for information extraction is presented. 
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
With the explosion in the quantity of online text and multimedia information in recent years,  there has been a renewed interest in the automated extraction of knowledge and information in various disciplines. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The work of(  Beigman Klebanov et al,  2004)  simplifies sentences by using MINIPAR parses as a starting point,  in a process similar to ours,  for the purpose of helping information seeking applications in their own task. 
(  Vickrey and Koller,  2008)  applies similar techniques,  using a sequence of rule based simp li fications of sentences,  to preprocess documents for Semantic Role Labeling. 
This abstract representation relies on the concept of Information Items(  INIT) ,  which we define as the smallest element of coherent information in a text or a sentence. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
An abs tractive summarization method consists of understanding the original text and retelling it in fewer words. 
Text Summarization is condensing the source text into a shorter version preserving its information content and overall meaning. 
attempts to develop an understanding of the main concepts in a document and then express those concepts in clear natural language. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
In order to implement extractive summarization,  some sentence extraction techniques are utilized to identify the most important sentences,  which can express the overall understanding of a given document. 
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
Extractive summarization is a simple but robust method for text summarization and it involves assigning saliency scores to some textual units of the documents and extracting those with highest scores. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
While we assume that topic representations will continue to evolve as more and more sophisticated text understanding applications are developed we want to consider the properties of the ideal topic representation for MDS such that it best informs the components for information selection and information ordering simultaneously. 
The problem of using topic representations for multi document summarization(  MDS)  has received considerable attention recently. 
Recent work in multi document summarization has leveraged information about the topics mentioned in a collection of documents in order to generate informative and coherent textual summaries. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
the type of statistical information extracted,  the representation chosen for the extracted information,  the method of similarity calculation. 
The AutoSummENG method for summarization evaluation is a promising method based on language neutral analysis of texts and comparison to gold standard summaries. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
Extractive summaries are formulated by extracting key text segments(  sentences or passages)  from the text,  based on statistical analysis of individual or mixed surface level features such as word phrase frequency,  location or cue words to locate the sentences to be extracted. 
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Other than the conversation structure,  the measures of cohesion and the graph based summarization methods we have proposed,  the importance of a sentence in emails can be captured from other aspects. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
We explored the email thread summarization problem using messages from the Enron corpus,  which consists of approximately half a million emails from the folders of 151 Enron employees. 
We present two approaches to email thread summarization. 
that CMS represents a better approach to email thread summarization,  and that current sentence compression techniques do not improve summarization performance in this genre. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
In this paper,  we employ concepts and metrics of complex networks to select sentences for an extractive summary. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
to tackle the summarization problem by combining complex network analysis. 
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
The different attempts in this field have shown that human quality text summarization was very complex since it encompasses discourse understanding,  abstraction,  and language generation(  Spar ck,  1993). 
In this paper,  we have investigated the use of genetic algorithm(  GA) ,  mathematical regression(  MR) ,  feed forward neural network(  FFNN) ,  probabilistic neural network(  PNN)  and Gaussian mixture model(  GMM)  for automatic text summarization task. 
In (Kulkarni and Prasad 2010):
This study intends to investigate Connectionist architecture for the Text Summarization system,  taking into account of existing new developments in adaptive evolving systems. 
In this study,  we consider the system of an Automatic Text Summarization as Evolving system which learns incrementally through experience in the environment. 
This study describes three approaches to Automated Text Summarization using connectionist statures based on. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
According to Mani and May bury(  1999) ,  automatic text summarization takes a partially structured source text from multiple texts written about the same topic,  extracts information content from it,  and presents the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs. 
This contrasts with abs tractive summarization,  where the information in the text is rephrased. 
The major concerns in graph based summarization researches include how to model the documents using text graph and how to transform existing web page ranking algorithms to their variations that could accommodate various summarization requirements(  Wenjie,  Furu,  Qin,  & Yanxiang,  2008). 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Nonetheless,  the majority of information retrieval and text summarization methods rely on shallow document representations that do not account for the semantics of events. 
Building on event graphs,  we propose novel models for event centered information retrieval and multi document text summarization. 
Building on these insights,  we present a multi document summarization model that filters the text based on the relevance of event mentions. 
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
This approach is based on the ICSI text summarization system(  Gil lick et al,  2008; Gil lick and Favre,  2009)  and was mo di ed for the fort he meeting domain in(  Gil lick et al,  2009)  . While most MMR implementations rely on words and their frequency throughout the data,  we could already show that using key phrases instead of words to model relevancy leads to better performance for meeting summarization(  Riedhammer et al,  a). 
For example,  while summarizing broadcast news is very similar to the summarization of textual documents,  conversations are much less structured and involve the interaction between multiple speakers Approachesforspeech summarization are mostly extractive and result in a selection of sentences from the input utterances. 
We analyze and compare two di erent methods for unsupervised extractive spontaneous speech summarization in the meeting domain. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
Text Summarization is condensing the source text into a shorter version preserving its information content and overall meaning. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (Ferreira et-al. 2014):
The 2002 conference was the last one that proposed the contest to create generic multi document summaries. 
The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an unsupervised generic summarization system,  that makes linguistic treatment of the input text by performing co reference resolution and discourse analysis,  besides using statistical and semantic similarities,  as in all previous work in the literature. 
The multi document summarization system proposed in this paper is based on statistical methods and linguistic treatment to increase information diversity of summaries also dealing with redundancy. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
Wang,  Li,  and Ding(  2010)  proposed the weighed feature subset nonnegative matrix factorization(  WFSNMF) ,  which is an unsupervised approach to simultaneously cluster data points and select important features and different data points are assigned different weights indicating their importance. 
Wang et al  (  2008)  proposed a framework based on sentence level semantic analysis and symmetric NMF(  nonnegative matrix factorization). 
In (Liu et-al. 2009):
The generic single document summarizer based on(  6)  is compared with the one in Wan et al. 
The experiments,  both on ageneric single document summarization evaluation,  and on a querybasedmultidocument evaluation,  verify the e ectiveness of the proposed measures and show that the proposed approach achieves a stateoftheartperformance. 
The proposed approach is described in Section 3,  followed by evaluations both on a generic single document setting,  and on a query based multidocumentsetting in Section 4. 
In (0017):
We propose a new unsupervised method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF)  to select sentences for automatic generic document summarization. 
Asa result,  LSArelated methods of document summarization may fail to extract meaningful sentences(  Lee & Seung,  1999; Zha,  2002)  In this paper,  we propose a new unsupervised generic document summarization method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF). 
While generic summarization distills the summarized text and presents the important semantic content of given documents,  query based summarization presents the summaries that are closely related to the query(  Mar cu,  1999; Mani & May bury,  1999; Mani,  2001)  Generally,  a document is comprised of major and minor topics. 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
In (Almeida and Martins 2013):
Automatic text summarization is a seminal problem in information retrieval and natural language processing(  Luhn,  1958; Baxendale,  1958; Edmund son,  1969). 
An alternative are coverage based models(  §2.1; Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou,  2004; Yih et al,  2007; Gil lick et al,  2008) ,  which seek a set of sentences that covers as many diverse concepts as possible redundancy is automatically penalized since redundant sentences cover fewer concepts. 
We present a dual decomposition framework for multi document summarization,  using a model that jointly extracts and compresses sentences. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
In contrast to tools like search,  which require the user to specify a query based on prior knowledge,  a set of threads provides an immediate,  concise,  high level summary of the collection,  not just identifying a set of important ob jects but also conveying the relationships between them. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
In (Otterbacher et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we focus on the query based or focused summarization problem where we seek to generate a summary of a set of related documents given a speci c aspect of their oft heir common topic formulated as a natural language query.

Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive. 
This paper describes 15 sentence scoring methods,  and some variation of them,  widely used and referenced in the literature applied to single document summarization in the last 10 years. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
We have described the use of complex networks concepts for extractive summarization,  as well as its evaluation through standard informativeness scores and significance tests. 
Although extractive summarization can produce texts that have cohesion and coherence problems,  many systems have been proven to yield summaries whose informative level is satisfactory.

The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
In (Sipos et-al. 2012):
In this paper,  we present a supervised learning approach to training sub modular scoring functions for extractive multi document summarization. 
The learning method applies to all sub modular summarization methods,  and we demonstrate its effectiveness for both pairwise as well as coverage based scoring functions on multiple data sets. 
Sentence extraction can also be implemented using other graph based scoring approaches(  Mihalcea,  2004)  such as HITS(  Klein berg,  1999)  and positional power functions. 
In (Ganesan et-al. 2010):
Going strictly by the definition of true abstraction(  Radev et al,  2002) ,  our problem formulation is still more extractive than abs tractive because the generated summary can only contain words that occur in the text to be summarized our problem definition may be regarded as a word level(  finer granularity)  extractive summarization. 
In this paper,  we described a novel summarization framework(  Opinosis)  that uses textual graphs to generate abs tractive summaries of highly redundant opinions. 
Graphs have been commonly used for extractive summarization(  e g,  LexRank(  Erk an and Radev,  2004)  and TextRank(  Mihalcea and Tarau,  2004) ) ,  but in these works the graph is often undirected with sentences as nodes and similarity as edges.

In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
Hence,  there is a need for novel graph based summarizers that also consider the correlations among multiple terms and the differences between positive and negative term correlations. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded.

In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005). 
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
To solve the optimization problem has been created an improved differential evolution algorithm. 
In (Song et-al. 2011):
In view of the nature of biological evolution,  we take advantage of several fuzzy control parameters to adaptively regulate the behaviors of the evolutionary optimization,  which can effectively prevent premature convergence to a local optimal solution. 
This paper proposes a fuzzy evolutionary optimization modeling(  FEOM)  and its applications to unsupervised categorization and extractive summarization. 
In our study,  a fuzzy evolutionary optimization model(  FEOM)  which applies several control parameters to adaptively regulate its evolutionary behavior is proposed as a generic data clustering method. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
A parallel effort has been devoted to using clustering algorithms for summarizing documents. 
This paper presents GraphSum,  a general purpose graph based summarizer that combines the association rules that were extracted from the analyzed documents in a graph based model in order to consider the correlations among multiple terms during the summarization process. 
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
In (Aliguliyev 2009):
The differential evolution algorithm for optimization procedure is given in Section 4. 
A key characteristic of many partition al clustering algorithms is that they use a global criterion function whose optimization drives the entire clustering process. 
In its classical form,  the DE algorithm is only applicable for optimization of continues variables. 
In (Storn R, Price K 1997):
Evolution Strategies(  ESs)  as well as Genetic Algorithms(  GAs)  belong to the broad class of evolutionary algorithms.

4.17-tImproving clustering at sentence-level with the help of ranking-based technique for theme-based summarization
In (Yang et-al. 2014):
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters. 
Sentence clustering plays a pivotal role in theme based summarization,  which discovers topic themes defined as the clusters of highly related sentences in order to avoid redundancy and cover more diverse information. 
Ranking based clustering Sentence clustering Theme based summarization. 
Thus,  good sentence clusters are the guarantee of good summaries in theme based summarization. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
We first discuss a total of six different sentence extraction methods(  EM1– EM6)  which correspond to the four baseline topic representation techniques(  TR1–TR4) ,  introduced in Section 2,  plus the two topic theme based representations based on TR5 introduced in Section 3.16 For ease of exposition,  we will refer to the graph based theme representation as TH1 and the linked list based theme representation as TH2. 
Second,  we believe that our results represent a comprehensive and replicable study,  which demonstrates the effectiveness of a structured,  theme based approach to multi document summarization. 
We believe that these results prove the benefits of using the theme based topic representation for multi document summarization.

In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
In our work,  we have considered both, (  1)  component based evaluations,  which evaluated each phase in the creation of a multi document summary separately,  and(  2)  intrinsic evaluations,  which evaluate the quality of each individual multi document summary generated by a summarization system. 
Now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust multi document summarization(  MDS)  systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary. 
In this article,  we perform what we believe to be the first comprehensive evaluation of the impact that different topic representation techniques have on the performance of a multi document summarization system. 
In (Ferreira et-al. 2014):
The multi document summarization system proposed in this paper is based on statistical methods and linguistic treatment to increase information diversity of summaries also dealing with redundancy. 
The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an unsupervised generic summarization system,  that makes linguistic treatment of the input text by performing co reference resolution and discourse analysis,  besides using statistical and semantic similarities,  as in all previous work in the literature. 
Such a purpose is achieved through a new sentence clustering algorithm based on a graph model that makes use of statistic similarities and linguistic treatment. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
Instead of a purely extractive approach,  we employ linguistic and statistical methods to generate multiple compressions,  and then select from those candidates to produce a final summary. 
Both our linguistic and statistical sentence compression techniques did not appear to perform well on Enron data,  due to outofgenre issues. 
On the other hand,  we expect that the purely statistical HMMbased approach will be more robust to text from different genres. 
In (Fung P, Ngai G 2006):
This article presents a multi document,  multilingual,  theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion(  story ow).

We propose a system of segmenting multiple multilingual documents into different topics or stories and then summarizing these stories. 
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
Most of the work in sentence extraction applied statistical techniques(  frequency analysis,  variance analysis,  etc)  to linguistic units such as tokens,  names,  anaphora,  etc   More recently,  other approaches have investigated the utility of discourse structure(  Mar cu,  1997) ,  the combination of information extraction and language generation(  Klavans and Shaw,  1995; McKeown et al,  1995) ,  and using machine learning to find patterns in text(  Teufel and Mo ens,  1997; Barzilay and Elhadad,  1997; Strzalkowski et al,  1998). 
Our approach addresses these issues by using domain independent techniques based mainly on fast,  statistical processing,  a metric for reducing redundancy and maximizing diversity in the selected passages,  and a modular framework to allow easy parameterization for different genres,  corpora characteristics and user requirements.

Our work,  in contrast,  aims to treat this limitation by using semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique to build semantic representation from the document text automatically. 
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. 
To the best of our knowledge,  semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique,  which exploits semantic role parser,  has not been employed for the semantic representation oftextin multi document abs tractive summarization.

Second,  by restricting it to a small number of generic argument types,  we make the extraction more robust,  avoiding the performance issues typically associated with fine grained semantic role labeling approaches. 
The extraction performance for all types except LOCATION is satisfactory(  and,  though not directly comparable,  is above the 70% F score typical for semantic role labeling systems). 
Query document matches are recognized based on a comparison of entities occupying the same semantic roles of the matching predicates.

4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Several real world machine learning applications involve hierarchy based categorization of topics for a set of objects. 
Given a collection of articles spanning different topics,  but with similar titles,  automatically generate a disambiguation page for those titles using the Wikipedia category hierarchy as a topic DAG. 
Let G(  V,  E)  be the DAG structured topic hierarchy with V topics. 
Given a DAGstructured topic hierarchy and a subset of objects,  we investigate the problem of finding a subset of DAGstructured topics that are induced by that subset(  of objects). 
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
In this paper,  we propose a document concept lattice that indexes the hierarchy of local topics tied to a set of frequent concepts and the corresponding sentences containing these topics. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
In this paper,  we review and detail our approach to automatic,  multi document extractive summarization. 
In (Lin and Bilmes 2010):
ILP Algorithms,  however,  can sometimes either be expensive for large scale problems or themselves might only be heuristic without associated theoretical approximation guarantees In this paper,  we study graph based approaches for multi document summarization. 
Erk an and Radev(  2004)  introduced a stochastic graph based method,  LexRank,  for computing the relative importance of textual units for multi document summarization. 
In multi document summarization,  redundancy is aparticularly important issue since textual units from different documents might convey the same information. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
Query focused summarization Query expansion Graph based ranking. 
Inspired by the success of graph based ranking,  we propose an approach of combining query expansion in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization. 
In (Bing et-al. 2015):
We propose an abstraction based multi document summarization framework that can construct new sentences by exploring more fine grained syntactic units than sentences,  namely,  noun verb phrases. 
Existing multi document summarization(  MDS)  methods fall in three categories. 
Most summarization systems adopt the extraction based approach which selects some original sentences from the source documents to create a short summary(  Erk an and Radev,  2004; Wan et al,  2007). 
In (Radev et-al. 2001):
Centroid based summarization of multi document clusters puts special emphasis on portions of these documents that are most central to the topic of the entire cluster. 
In this paper,  we present our recent work on the development of a scalable personalized webbasedmultidocument summarization and recommendation system. 
We will introduce an e ective search engine to summarize clusters of related web pages which provide more contextual and summary information to help users explore the retrieval result more e ciently We describe in this paper a system,  WebInEssence,  which blends the traditional information retrieval technology with advanced document clustering,  document recommendation,  and multi document summarization technology in an integrated framework Text summarization is the process of selecting the most salient information in one or more textual documents. 
In (Fung P, Ngai G 2006):
This article presents a multi document,  multilingual,  theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion(  story ow). 
In this article,  we propose stochastic Hidden Markov Story Models(  HMSM)  for multi document extractive summarization. 
In extraction based summarization,  salient sentences are automatically extracted to form a sum mary directly Kupiec et al   1995; Myaeng and Jang 1999; Jing et al   2000; Nomoto and Matsumoto 2001,  2002; Zha 2002; Osborne 2002. 
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
Our system predicts sentence salience in the context of a large scale event,  such as a disaster,  and integrates these predictions into a clustering based multi document summarization system. 
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,  increasing the quality of the updates. 
While we evaluate these features in the domain of disasters,  this approach is generally applicable to many update summarization tasks. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
For instance,  in Figure a weak pose detector favors large clusters of poses that are nearly identical,  but lteringthrough a DPP ensures that the nal predictions are well separated Throughout this survey we demonstrate applications for DPPs in a variety of settings,  including. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The goal of learning is to choose appropriate θ based on the training sample so that we can make accurate predictions on unseen inputs While there are a variety of ob jective functions commonly used for learning,  here we will focus on maximum likelihood learning(  or maximum likelihood estimation,  often abbreviatedMLE) ,  where the goal is to choose θ to maximize the conditional log likelihood of the Optimizing L is consistent under mild assumptions that is,  if the training data are actually drawn from a conditional DPP with parameter θ∗,  then the learned θ → θ∗ as T → Of course real data are unlikely to exactly follow any particular model,  but in any case reasonable probability estimates,  since maximizing L can be seen as minimizing the loglossthe maximum likelihood approach has the advantage of calibrating the DPP to produce on the training data To optimize the log likelihood,  we will use standard algorithms such as gradient ascent or LBFGS Nocedal,  1980. 
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
Conventional IR systems find and rank documents based on maximizing relevance to the user query(  Salton,  1970; van Rijsbergen,  1979; Buckley,  1985; Salton,  1989). 
Consider the situation where the user issues a search query,  for instance on a news topic,  and the retrieval system finds hundreds of closely ranked documents in response. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
In (Carenini et-al. 2007):
Wan et al generate an affinity graph from multiple documents and use this graph for summarization. 
Our preliminary results show that both the quotation graph and clue words are valuable for summarizing email conversations. 
Thus,  in Section 5,  we present results of a user study on summarizing 20 conversations from the Enron data set. 
4.23.12-tPhrase-based compressive cross-language summarization
4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In (Graham 2015):
An analysis of evaluation of summarization metrics was provided with an evaluation of BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE. 
In total,  therefore,  when employing ROUGE for the evaluation of summarization systems,  there are 192(  8 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2)  possible system level variants to choose from. 
We subsequently replicate a recent large scale evaluation that relied on,  what we now know to be,  suboptimal ROUGE variants revealing distinct conclusions about the relative performance of stateoftheart summarization systems. 
In (Lin 2004):
In this paper,  we introduced ROUGE,  an automatic evaluation package for summarization,  and conducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic measures included in the ROUGE package using three years of DUC data. 
We found that(  1)  ROUGE2,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  and ROUGES worked well in single document summarization tasks, (  2)  ROUGE1,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 performed great in evalua ting very short summaries(  or headline like summaries) , (  3)  correlation of high 90% was hard to achieve for multi document summarization tasks but ROUGE1,  ROUGE2,  ROUGES4,  ROUGES9,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 worked reasonably well when stop words were exc luded from match ing, (  4)  exclusion of stop words usually improved correlation,  and(  5)  correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references. 
Therefore,  how to evaluate summaries automatically has drawn a lot of at tent ion in the summarization research community in recent years. 
In (Dunlavy et-al. 2007):
We demonstrate the improved performance by a series of experiments using standard test sets from the Document Understanding Conferences(  DUC)  as measured by the best known automatic metric for summarization system evaluation,  ROUGE. 
The benefit of using QCS over such methods is that it is a fully automatic system for document retrieval,  organization,  and summarization. 
Much of the recent research on automatic text summarization systems is available in the proceedings of the 2001–2006 Document Understanding Conferences The focus of these conferences is the evaluation and discussion of summarization algorithms and systems in performing sets of tasks on several types of document collections. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
The problem of using topic representations for multi document summarization(  MDS)  has received considerable attention recently. 
,  we evaluated summaries using five variants of the ROUGE automatic summary evaluation algorithm. 
We have evaluated each of these summarization methods using a number of standard techniques,  including the ROUGE automatic scoring packages and the manual Pyramid evaluation method. 
In (0017):
We propose a new unsupervised method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF)  to select sentences for automatic generic document summarization. 
As a result,  the method selects more meaningful sentences for generic document summarization than those selected using LSA.Ó 2008 Else vier Ltd. 
Document summarization is an essential technology to overcome this obstacle in technological environments Automatic document summarization is the process of reducing the size of documents while presenting the important semantic content.

6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In (CR100):
In this section,  we explain previous work on recentabstractive summarization,  and we stress our novelty with respect to other similar approaches An approach for combining different fragments of information that have been extracted from one or more document sis documents is suggested in. 
In order to solve this limitation,  besides checking for the correctness of the sentences once they have been generated and filtering out those ones,  which do not satisfy the proposed constraints,  we would also need to apply some constraints based on the information sentences contain,  optimizing the set of generated sentences,  so that only the best ones with respect to their content are used With respect to the general results of the abstractiveapproaches,  since the length of the summaries is restricted to only 100 words,  when selecting the most important sentences before or after generating new sentences,  some of the oft he concepts may not be included. 
This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
This paper proposes two approaches to address text summarization. 
Table 1 shows the outputs of our approaches in different phases of the text summarization process. 
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels.

8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Banerjee et-al. 2015):
In manual evaluation,  our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and readability. 
Further,  manual evaluation by human judges shows that our technique produces summaries with acceptable linguistic quality and high informativeness. 
Evaluators were asked to rate the summaries based on informativeness(  the amount of information conveyed)  and linguistic quality(  readability of the summary). 
To select the best paths from the clusters,  we combine informativeness I(  p Cj i)  and linguistic quality LQ(  p Cj i)  in an optimization framework. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
The evaluation setup and comparative results regarding informativeness scores are presented and discussed in Section 4. 
We have described the use of complex networks concepts for extractive summarization,  as well as its evaluation through standard informativeness scores and significance tests. 
This type of analysis depends only on the corpus employed,  not on a fixed compression rate or specific informativeness score. 
In (Patel et-al. 2007):
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e.

We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence.

8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
In order to make our experiments more relevant,  we have used the evaluation thee valuation framework of a large scale project for evaluating text summarization algorithms. 
Our text summarization algorithm is based on computing the value of aTFISF(  term frequency – inverse sentence frequency)  measure for each word,  which is an adaptation of the conventional TFIDF(  term frequency – inverse document frequency)  measure of information retrieval. 
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
This is a welcome volume for both researchers and teachers who are interested in extending the traditional boundaries of Information Retrieval to include related information access and analytic applications such as summarization,  extraction,  and question answering Text summarization,  which is de ned by the editors as the process of distilling the most important information from a source(  s)  to produce an abridged version for a particular user(  s)  and task(  s)  ” is a technology that has been worked on for more than forty years anda capability that users have long desired. 
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting.
