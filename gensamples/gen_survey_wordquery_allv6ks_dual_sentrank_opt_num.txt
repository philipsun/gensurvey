Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Moawad IF, Aref M 2012):
The input graph contains the information needed to generate the final text. 
To achieve its task,  the phase accesses the domain ontology,  which contains the information needed in the same domain of RSG to generate the final texts. 
The exponential growth in data increases the need for intelligent filtering and knowledge based approaches to reduce the time needed to absorb the key facts in documents and to avoid drowning in it. 
Keywords Text Summarization Abs tractive Summary Semantic Representation Rich Semantic Graph Semantic Graph. 
To achieve its task,  the phase accesses the domain ontology,  which contains the information needed in the same domain of RSG. 
This phase accepts a semantic representation in the form of RSG and generates the summarized text. 
One of the important Natural Language Processing applications is Text Summarization,  which helps users to manage the vast amount of information available,  by condensing documents content and extracting the most relevant facts or topics included. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (0079):
Coherent text is characterized by various types of cohesive links that facilitate text comprehension(  Halliday and Has an,  1976). 
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non discourse features(  Miltsakaki and Kukich,  2000). 
The use of rare words or technical terminology for example can make text difficult to read for certain audience types(  CollinsThompson and Call an,  2004; Sch warm Schwa rm and Ostendorf,  2005; Elhadad and Sutaria,  2007). 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
Although ROUGE takes into account contextual information,  it remains at the word level,  which means we either regard different types of the same word as different or we need to apply(  language dependent)  stemming or lemmatization to remove this effect. 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
systems(  4) ,  types(  3) ,  solutions(  3) ,  minimal(  3) ,  linear(  2) ,  in equations(  2) ,  algorithms(  2). 
Upper bounds for components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given. 
For the same text,  a frequency approach provides the following top ranked lexical units. 
These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered types systems and systems of mixed types. 
In (Carlson et-al. 2003):
Thus,  our approach contributes to the community quite differently from detailed analyses of specific discourse phenomena in depth,  such as anaphoric relations(  Gar side et al,  1997)  or style types(  Leech et al,  1997)  ; analysis of a single text from multiple perspectives(  Mann and Thompson,  1992)  ; or illustrations of a theoretical model on a single representative text(  Brit ton Britt on and Black,  1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch,  1983). 
The annotators hired to build the corpus were all professional language analysts with prior experience in other types of data annotation. 
textual organization,  span,  and same unit(  used to link parts of units separated by embedded units or spans). 
In (Barzilay and Lapata 2005):
Each text can thus be viewed as a distribution defined over transition types. 
Note that considerable latitude is available when specifying the transition types to be included in a feature vector. 
there is often no single coherent rendering of a given text but many different possibilities that can be partially ordered. 
Second,  we examined the effect of different types of summaries(  human vs. 
This approach has been shown to be highly effective in various tasks ranging from collaborative filtering(  Joachims,  a)  to parsing(  Toutanova et al,  2004). 
In (Carenini et-al. 2007):
The selected emails also need to represent different types of conversation structure. 
According to our preliminary study,  we found that the email threads could be divided into two types. 
In order to cover both structure in the context of email summarization,  we randomly select 4 single chains and 16 trees,  which is close to their ratio in the 38 conversations. 
In our experimentation,  we observe that stemming occurs the most frequently among the three types discussed above. 
Since we are studying multiple email summarization in a conversational context,  we required that each conversation contained at least 4 emails. 
In (Rush et-al. 2015):
We apply a minimal preprocessing step using PTB tokenization,  lower casing,  replacing all digit characters with #,  and replacing of word types seen less than 5 times with UNK. 
Gigaword contains around 9.5 million news articles sourced from various domestic and international news services over the last two decades. 
The complete input training vocabulary consists of 119 million word tokens and K unique word types with an average sentence size of 31. 
Unlike BLEU which interpolates various ngram matches,  there are several versions of ROUGE for different match lengths. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
We can then use the DPP content model wit ha size model of our choosing,  or simply set the desired size based on context. 
But while this distribution characterizes certain types of data,  other cases might look very di erent. 
This is a serious limitation on the types of distributions than can be expressed for instance,  a DPP cannot even capture the uniform distribution over sets of cardinality k More generally,  even for applications where the number of items is unknown,  the size model imposed by a DPP may not be a good t. 
Samples from the model,  like the one presented in the gure,  not only o er some immediate intuition about the types of papers contained in the collection,  but also,  upon examining individual threads,  provide a succinct illustration of the content and development of each area. 
In (Grosz et-al. 1995):
We defined various centering constructs and proposed two centering rules in terms of these constructs. 
Our original paper(  Grosz,  Jos hi,  and Weinstein 1983)  on centering claimed that certain entities mentioned in an utterance were more central than others and that this property imposed constraints on a speaker'  s use of different types of referring expressions. 
The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions,  given a particular attentional state. 
In (Hearst 1997):
With the increase in importance of multimedia information,  especially in the context of Digital Library projects,  the need for segmentation and summarization of alternative media types is becoming increasingly important. 
In a line of work we call MixedMedia access(  Chen et al   1994) ,  textual subtopic structure is being integrated with other media types,  such as images and speech. 
coding discourse and dialogue phenomena,  and especially coding segment boundaries,  may be inherently more difficult than many previous types of content analysis(  for instance,  dividing newspaper articles based on subject matter) "  and so implies that the levels of agreement needed to indicate good reliability for TextTiling may be justified in being lower. 
In (Radev et-al. 2001):
• Di erent color schemes for di erent types of information Di erent colors were used for display of various types of information. 
WebInEssence uses two types of clustered input – either the set of hits that the user has selected or the output of our own clustering engine – CIDR(  Radevet al,  1999)  It uses an iterative algorithm that creates as a side product the so called document centroids. 
To illustrate the types of summaries produced byWebInEssence,  we enclose the rst four sentences of the summary for cluster 00018. 
• Keyword in context The keyword used for the query is automatically highlighted on all the contextual information. 
In (Dunlavy et-al. 2007):
Much of the recent research on automatic text summarization systems is available in the proceedings of the 2001–2006 Document Understanding Conferences The focus of these conferences is the evaluation and discussion of summarization algorithms and systems in performing sets of tasks on several types of document collections. 
Most importantly,  the combination of the three types of methods in the QCS design improves retrievals by providing users more focused information organized by topic. 
We present a novel integrated information retrieval system the Query,  Cluster,  Summarize(  QCS)  system which is portable,  modular,  and permits experimentation with different instantiations of each of the constituent text analysis components. 
In (Nobata et-al. 2001):
First,  we explain scoring functions used in the system,  and then mention the other parts,  such as threshold types,  patterns and parameters the system uses. 
Each evidence is integrated using parameters,  which are estimated using training data Suitable parameter sets can be selected at each section information and compression ratio In the following sections,  we explain methods used in our system,  then show and discuss the evaluation results on the TSC,  Text Summarization Challenge,  which was held by National Information Institute. 
Various clues have been used for sentence extraction. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
The recognition of discourse relations between text units can be performed by using a combination of features that represent(  a)  alignment between entities and predicates from each text that encode similar types of lexicosemantic information(  b)  alignment based on functional similarity or inclusion(  c)  alignment based on semantic information specific to each discourse relation(  e g. 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Although GistSumm also determines the gist of a source text,  its approach is purely statistical,  avoiding the inherent complexity of those deep based ones. 
This paper presents a method for text summarization based on the gist of a source text that differs from the related ones in Computational Linguistics. 
Using simple statistical measures,  gist is identified as the most important passage of the source text,  conveyed by just one sentence. 
approaches. 
In a similar deep approach based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory. 
The novelty of our gist based method,  embedded in the so called GistSumm(  GIST SUMMarizer)  system,  consists of both the way gist is identified and used to produce the extract. 
We have chosen two simple statistical methods in order to determine a gist sentence,  which is the backbone of text extraction,  for two reasons. 
The main goal of this research is to implement AMADEUS as an agent based architecture with collaborative agents communicating with a special agent embodying a dynamic user model. 
This shows the following.

scientific texts,  namely,  the Theses Corpus. 
AMADEUS consists of several interrelated tools - reference,  support,  critic and tutoring tools - and provides the context in which this dissertation is inserted The main goal of this research is to implement AMADEUS as an agent based architecture with collaborative agents communicating with a special agent embodying a dynamic user model In order to do that we introduce the concept of adaptivity in computer systems and describe several user model shells We also provide details about intelligent agents which were used to implement the user model for the AMADEUS environment. 
English is the dominant language in the writing and publishing of scientific research in the form of scientific articles However,  many nonnatives users of English suffer the interference of their mother tongues when writing scientific papers in English These users face problems concerning rules of grammar and style,  and or feel unable to generate standard expressions and clauses,  and the longer linguistic compositions which are conventional in this genre In order to ease these users'  problems,  we developed a learning environment for scientific writing named AMADEUS(  Amiable Article Development for User Support)  .. 
This is explained below,  along with the description of its processes. 
The key point in GistSumm is,  thus,  to identify those sentences that better correlate to gist. 
By means of the gist sentence,  it is possible to build coherent extracts,  which will convey the gist sentence itself and those extra sentences that may complement it,  and,  thus,  make extracts more informative. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
Although the abstraction based method can summarize a document more accurately than the extraction based method,  it is much more difficult and complex because it requires the use of high cost natural language processing technologies,  such as information fusion(  Barzilay,  McKeown,  & Elhadad,  1999) ,  sentence compression(  Knight & Mar cu,  2002) ,  and reformulation(  McKeown,  Klavans,  Hatzivassiloglou,  Barzilay,  & Es kin,  1999). 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
The basic idea implemented by a graph based ranking model is that of voting or recommendation. 
In this paper,  we introduce the TextRank graph based ranking model for graphs extracted from natural language texts. 
Applying a similar line of thinking to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents,  results in a graph based ranking model that can be applied to a variety of natural language processing applications,  where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking selection decisions. 
Graph based ranking algorithms are essentially away of deciding the importance of a vertex withina graph,  based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Indeed,  if we discourse analyze the sample text based on the RST Theory. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Sections 3 Modified corpus based approach,  4 LSA give a detail description of our proposed approaches. 
Both approaches concentrate on single document summarization and generate indicative,  2 extract based summaries. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
The second uses latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
Thus,  we conclude that LSA can be employed to promote text summarization from keyword level analysis to semantic level analysis. 
Hence,  we conclude that LSA can be employed to promote text summarization from keyword level analysis to semantic level analysis. 
Latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  is a mathematical technique for extracting and inferring relations of expected contextual usage of words in passages of discourse(  Deer wester et al,  1990; Landau er et al,  1998). 
The second one exploits latent semantic analysis(  LSA) (  Deer wester,  Duma is,  Furn as,  Landau er,  & Harsh man,  1990; Landau er,  Foltz,  & La ham,  1998)  and a text relationship map(  T.R.M.) (  Salton et al,  1997)  to derive semantically salient structures from a document. 
one used relevance measure to rank sentence relevance,  and the other used latent semantic analysis to identify semantically important sentences. 
We conclude that LSA can be employed to promote text summarization from keyword level analysis to semantic level analysis. 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
(  Vickrey and Koller,  2008)  applies similar techniques,  using a sequence of rule based simp li fications of sentences,  to preprocess documents for Semantic Role Labeling. 
They applied this technique to extractive summarization in(  Rusu et al,  2009)  by building what the authors call semantic graphs,  derived from triplets,  and then using said graphs to identify the most interesting sentences for the summary. 
The work of(  Beigman Klebanov et al,  2004)  simplifies sentences by using MINIPAR parses as a starting point,  in a process similar to ours,  for the purpose of helping information seeking applications in their own task. 
Thus,  we want to move away from the current way we generate sentences,  which is too similar to rule based sentence compression. 
We compute a score based on the frequencies of the terms in the sentences generated from the INITs and select sentences that way. 
Sentence fusion first identifies themes(  clusters of similar sentences)  from the source documents and selects which themes are important for the summary(  a process similar to the sentence selection of centroid based extractive summarization methods(  Radev et al,  2004) )  and then generates a representative sentence for each theme by sentence fusion. 
Generating sentences that do not all sound similar and generic is an additional challenge that we have for now circumvented by reusing the original sentence structure to a large extent,  which is a type of texttotext generation. 
The work of(  Barzilay and McKeown,  2005)  on sentence fusion shows an example of reusing the same syntactical structure of a source sentence to create a new one with a slightly different meaning. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
In this paper,  we propose a document concept lattice that indexes the hierarchy of local topics tied to a set of frequent concepts and the corresponding sentences containing these topics. 
• Motivated by our evaluation metric on answer loss,  we propose a novel document model,  the document concept lattice,  which indexes sentences with respect to their coverage of overlapping concepts. 
Once words that represent unified concepts in the documents are linked,  we represent the sources as a document concept lattice(  DCL). 
Following our work in DUC 2005 and 2006,  we proposed a document concept lattice(  DCL)  model and the corresponding algorithm for summarization. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
the type of statistical information extracted,  the representation chosen for the extracted information,  the method of similarity calculation. 
The AutoSummENG method for summarization evaluation is a promising method based on language neutral analysis of texts and comparison to gold standard summaries. 
The method presented herein matches and even exceeds the correlation of the aforementioned methodologies on the newer,  DUC 20065 data in a language neutral,  statistical manner,  while taking into account contextual information. 
The over information common ground of recent information retrieval efforts has created a serious motive for the design and implementation of summarization systems,  which are either based on existing information retrieval practices or provide a new pointofview on the retrieval process. 
These categories of ngrams are based on statistical criteria and are used to describe how noise can deteriorate the performance of our method as a function of the methodology parameters. 
A number of different intermediate representations of summaries information have been introduced in existing summarization evaluation literature,  ranging from automatically extracted snippets to human decided sub sentential portions of text. 
evaluation frameworks uses statistical measures of similarity based on ngrams of words,  4 although it supports different kinds of analysis,  ranging from ngram to semantic Hovy et al   b. 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Subjective opinions are often critical in many conversations. 
Summarizing email conversations is challenging due to the characteristics of emails,  especially the conversational nature. 
Other than the conversation structure,  the measures of cohesion and the graph based summarization methods we have proposed,  the importance of a sentence in emails can be captured from other aspects. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
We explored the email thread summarization problem using messages from the Enron corpus,  which consists of approximately half a million emails from the folders of 151 Enron employees. 
Previous work has employed a corpus of emails sent among the board members of the ACM chapter at Columbia University(  Ram bow,  Shrestha,  Chen,  & Lauridsen,  2004). 
Unlike news wire text,  which is meant for general consumption by a wide audience,  emails are only intended for their recipients. 
The general problem of email summarization is not new. 
Email represents an instance of informal text – a broader genre that includes conversational speech,  blogs,  instant and SMS messages,  etc   Interest in automated processing techniques for informal media has been growing over the past few years for many reasons. 
In (Carenini et-al. 2007):
Since we are studying multiple email summarization in a conversational context,  we required that each conversation contained at least 4 emails. 
In other words the chain in clue word is not only lexical but also conversational,  and typically spans over several emails(  i e,  documents). 
Not only does this study provide a gold standard to evaluate CWS and other summarization methods,  but it also sheds light on the importance of clue words and hidden emails to human summarizers. 
This clearly shows that the hidden emails do carry crucial information and have to be considered by the email summarization system. 
Email summarization can also be valuable for users reading emails with mobile devices. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
In this paper,  we employ concepts and metrics of complex networks to select sentences for an extractive summary. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
Automatic summarization Complex networks Network measurements Sentence extraction Summary informativeness. 
The proposed method,  called CNSumm(  Complex Networks based Summarization) ,  consists of four steps. 
We have described the use of complex networks concepts for extractive summarization,  as well as its evaluation through standard informativeness scores and significance tests. 
network measurements,  which are neither language nor domain dependent,  can be used for extractive summarization,  and can lead to informativeness scores close to the more linguistically complex and computationally costly systems. 
This should perhaps be expected,  as the measurements of complex networks have already been shown to capture important features of texts. 
Thus,  the potential of our approach could be assessed by maintaining the focus on the summarization algorithms rather than on the construction of the networks. 
Another concept borrowed from the complex networks field is the notion of communities,  which correspond to groups of nodes that are highly interconnected,  while different groups are scarcely connected to each other. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (Liu et-al. 2009):
The generic single document summarizer based on(  6)  is compared with the one in Wan et al. 
The experiments,  both on ageneric single document summarization evaluation,  and on a querybasedmultidocument evaluation,  verify the e ectiveness of the proposed measures and show that the proposed approach achieves a stateoftheartperformance. 
The proposed approach is described in Section 3,  followed by evaluations both on a generic single document setting,  and on a query based multidocumentsetting in Section 4. 
The experiments,  both on the task 1 of DUC02 which focuses on generic single document summarizing,  and on the main task of DUC07 whose goal is to produce a query based summary for a set of related documents,  illustrate that our proposed approaches achieve a stateoftheart performance Particularly noteworthy about our approach are the following points. 
Based on this proposed word information qu anti cation measure,  a sentence ssigni cance value for a generic summarization is computed using(  5)  where m is the number of words in sentence s,  I(  w)  is set to 1 when w is a keyword,  otherwise,  info(  w)  is equivalent to info(  w)  in(  2)  when w is a keyword,  otherwise When the documents to be processed are news articles,  a feature about sentence. 
A new word signi cance measure is proposed in this paper To sum up,  a generic summary aims to distill the overall meaning of a document,  and extractive summarization reaches this ob jective by selecting the most important sentences from the document. 
The consequent conclusion is that all the summaries for di erent documents are composed of similar word sets. 
generic single generics ingle document summarization and query based multi document summarization. 
The above mentioned tf idfmetric,  which has similar form with ours,  also takes part in this comparison The comparison experiments are carried out following the task 1 of DUC02.Provided 567 English news articles,  task 1 aims to create a generic summary for each document with a length of approximately 100 words. 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
Text summarization is the process of automatically creating a compressed version of a given text that provides useful information for the user(  Ye et al,  2007,  Steinberger et al,  2007,  Dorr and Gaasterland,  2007,  Diaz and Gerv s,  2007). 
Moreover,  we use all feature parameters to train feed forward neural network(  FFNN) ,  probabilistic neural network(  PNN)  and Gaussian mixture model(  GMM)  in order to construct a text summarizer for each model. 
In this paper,  we have investigated the use of genetic algorithm(  GA) ,  mathematical regression(  MR) ,  feed forward neural network(  FFNN) ,  probabilistic neural network(  PNN)  and Gaussian mixture model(  GMM)  for automatic text summarization task. 
Section 2 presents the different text feature parameters,  Section 3 is about the proposed automatic summarization model,  Section 4 shows the experimental results and finally Section 5 presents conclusions and future work. 
Text summarization addresses both the problem of selecting the most important portions of text and the problem of generating coherent summaries. 
The different attempts in this field have shown that human quality text summarization was very complex since it encompasses discourse understanding,  abstraction,  and language generation(  Spar ck,  1993). 
Some were about evaluation of summarization using relevance prediction(  Hob son Hobs on et al,  2007) ,  ROUGEeval package(  Sj bergh,  2007) ,  SUMMAC,  NTCIR,  and DUC(  Over et al,  2007)  and voted regression model(  Hirao et al,  2007). 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
We demonstrate structured DPPs on a toy geographical paths problem,  a still image multiple pose estimation task,  and two high dimensional text threading tasks. 
In (Sarkar 2010):
Multi document summarization is a process,  which produces a condensed representation of the contents of multiple related text documents collected from heterogeneous sources for human consumption and facilitates very rapid assimilation by human beings of the main points from related documents. 
(  1)  extracting important textual units from multiple related documents, (  2)  removing redundancies and(  3)  reordering or fusion of the units to produce a fluent summary. 
In extractive multi document summarization task,  summary sentences come from multiple source documents,  and picking sentences out of context may result in an incoherent summary. 
Before applying sentence ranking algorithm,  input documents are broken in to a cluster of sentences. 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  modeled extractive document summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
In Table 2,  Table 3 MCMR(  Maximum Coverage and Minimum Redundant)  denotes the proposed method(  in brackets by the B&B and PSO respectively denoted the branchandbound and particle swarm optimization algorithms which have been used for solving the optimization problem). 
In particular,  we model text summarization as an integer linear programming problem. 
To tackle this pressing text information overload problem,  document clustering(  Aliguliyev,  2009,  Aliguliyev,  2009,  Wang et al,  2008)  and text summarization(  Aliguliyev,  2006,  Aliguliyev,  2010,  Alguliev and Alyguliev,  2008,  Alguliev and Aliguliyev,  2009,  Alguliev et al,  2005)  together have been used as a solution. 
For this reason,  document clustering and text summarization can be used for important components of information retrieval systems(  Yoo,  Hu,  & Song,  2007). 
► We model unsupervised generic text summarization as an optimization problem. 
That is why document clustering enables us to group similar text information and then text summarization provides condensed text information for the similar text by extracting the most important text content from a similar document set or a document cluster. 
The proposed generic text summarization model is presented in Section 3. 
Though text summarization has drawn attention primarily after the information explosion on the Internet,  the first work has been done as early as in the s(  Luhn,  1958). 
In this paper,  we focus on the unsupervised generic text summarization,  which generates a summary by extracting key textual units in given document collection. 
In these tables through MCMR(  Maximum Coverage and Minimum Redundant)  denoted our model with the objective function f.

In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
We analyze and compare two di erent methods for unsupervised extractive spontaneous speech summarization in the meeting domain. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
For example,  while summarizing broadcast news is very similar to the summarization of textual documents,  conversations are much less structured and involve the interaction between multiple speakers Approachesforspeech summarization are mostly extractive and result in a selection of sentences from the input utterances. 
In (Azmi AM, Al-Thanyyan S 2012):
A comprehensive evaluation in Uz da et al  (  2008)  has concluded that automatic text summarization methods which are based on RST are better than extractive summarizers and those with hybrid methods produce worse summaries.

In this paper,  we present a supervised learning approach to training sub modular scoring functions for extractive multi document summarization. 
The learning method applies to all sub modular summarization methods,  and we demonstrate its effectiveness for both pairwise as well as coverage based scoring functions on multiple data sets.

In (Ganesan et-al. 2010):
Going strictly by the definition of true abstraction(  Radev et al,  2002) ,  our problem formulation is still more extractive than abs tractive because the generated summary can only contain words that occur in the text to be summarized our problem definition may be regarded as a word level(  finer granularity)  extractive summarization. 
Graphs have been commonly used for extractive summarization(  e g,  LexRank(  Erk an and Radev,  2004)  and TextRank(  Mihalcea and Tarau,  2004) ) ,  but in these works the graph is often undirected with sentences as nodes and similarity as edges. 
Extractive methods also tend to be verbose and this is especially problematic when the summaries need to be viewed on smaller screens like on a PDA. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
Although extractive summarization can produce texts that have cohesion and coherence problems,  many systems have been proven to yield summaries whose informative level is satisfactory. 
A graph,  or network,  is a representation that may capture text structure in various ways,  being therefore suitable for extractive summarization.

Hence,  there is a need for novel graph based summarizers that also consider the correlations among multiple terms and the differences between positive and negative term correlations. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded.

Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
Unlike all of the above mentioned approaches,  our summarizer discovers association rules from the analyzed document to also represent the correlations among multiple terms in the graph based model.

In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters. 
Sentence clustering plays a pivotal role in theme based summarization,  which discovers topic themes defined as the clusters of highly related sentences in order to avoid redundancy and cover more diverse information.

Now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust multi document summarization(  MDS)  systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary.

Therefore,  in this paper,  we attempt to devise an approach to the generation of the topic aspect oriented summarization according to topic factors,  we call this TAOS(  Topic AspectOriented Summarization). 
Analogously,  the summary about one topic sky may prefer color based features while one summary about topic car is more likely to mention edge based features. 
Abstract based approaches can be considered as a synthesis of the original documents while the extraction based approaches focus on how to utilize the extracted elements(  always sentences or images)  to generate a concise description of original documents. 
Of particular interest to us in this paper is the extractive multi document summarization,  where the obtained final summary is a subset of the elements from multiple input documents. 
Documents summarization can be generally categorized as two approaches. 
While stop words are removed,  our TAOS outperforms in the vast majority of metrics of ROUGE1,  and we think the reason is that the summaries generated by TAOS can convey more meaningful aspects than summaries by SubSVM due to the nature of group selection in TAOS.

Let G(  V,  E)  be the DAG structured topic hierarchy with V topics.

This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
In light of this,  Text Summarization(  TS)  is of great help since its main aim is to produce a condensed new text containing a significant portion of the information in the original text(  s)  The process of summarization can be divided into three stages. 
In this section,  we explain previous work on recentabstractive summarization,  and we stress our novelty with respect to other similar approaches An approach for combining different fragments of information that have been extracted from one or more document sis documents is suggested in. 
In order to solve this limitation,  besides checking for the correctness of the sentences once they have been generated and filtering out those ones,  which do not satisfy the proposed constraints,  we would also need to apply some constraints based on the information sentences contain,  optimizing the set of generated sentences,  so that only the best ones with respect to their content are used With respect to the general results of the abstractiveapproaches,  since the length of the summaries is restricted to only 100 words,  when selecting the most important sentences before or after generating new sentences,  some of the oft he concepts may not be included.

Those are added to the extract provided that they satisfy summarization requirements,  namely,  gist preservation,  textuality,  relevance,  and compression constraints. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information.

By making GistSumm gist based,  we assume it emulates human summarization in that,  when a person summarizes a text,  s he first tries to identify the gist and,  then,  adds information drawn from the text to complement it. 
Although many authors have stressed the need to convey the main idea and to warrant the textuality of the results in automatic summarization. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Although GistSumm also determines the gist of a source text,  its approach is purely statistical,  avoiding the inherent complexity of those deep based ones.

According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
Knowledge poor approaches do not consider any knowledge pertaining to the domain to which text summarization is applied therefore,  knowledge poor approaches can be easily applied to any domain(  Abracos & Lopes,  1997; Gong & Liu,  2001; Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; May eng & Jang,  1999; Salton et al,  1997; Mitra,  Singh al,  & Buckley,  1997). 
In this paper,  we propose two text summarization approaches. 
outperforms keyword based text summarization approaches. 
Nowadays,  corpus based approaches play an important role in text summarization(  Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; Lin & Hovy,  1997; Teufel & Mo ens,  1997; Yeh et al,  2002). 
both with single documents and at the corpus level to investigate the competence of LSA in text summarization. 
Text search and text summarization are two essential technologies to address this problem. 
On the other hand,  text summarization can be roughly classified into two categories according to how much domain knowledge is involved(  Hahn & Mani,  2000). 
both in single document level and corpus level to investigate the competence of LSA in text summarization. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
As mentioned in Section 1,  motivated by the success of PageRanklike ranking algorithms in webpage ranking,  a number of graph based approaches have been applied to automatic text summarization. 
When applied to the task of text summarization,  these approaches can make full use of the relationships between sentences and find the most important sentences to be extracted into the summary. 
However,  such approaches to query expansion are restricted in what they can expand,  because they cannot be applied to words not in WordNet such as named entities which frequently occur in queries,  and without performing word sense disambiguation,  adding all the synonyms of a word will inevitably bring noises,  and furthermore,  much context related information cannot be captured by only synonyms. 
Other typical query focused summarization methods such as maximal marginal relevance(  MMR)  combine query relevance with information novelty in text summarization(  Carbon ell and Gold stein,  1998,  Gold stein et al,  2000). 
The initial focus on the query focused task was SUMMAC which was the first large scale,  developer independent evaluation of automatic text summarization systems(  Mani et al,  1998) ,  and it was then replaced by the DUC evaluation which was mainly for the generic summarization at its early stage. 
Section 2 gives a brief overview of previous work on text summarization. 
Erk an and Radev(  2004)  proposed LexRank for generic text summarization. 
In (Kallimani et-al. 2011):
The previous work in automatic summarization has completely focused on extractive summarization,  in which key sentences are identified from the source text and extracted to form the output. 
An alternative solution is abs tractive summarization in which the information from the source text is first extracted into the form of abstract data which is then post processed to infer the most important message from the original text. 
We modeled the problem of text summarization as an IR problem. 
Extractive and abs tractive summarization Stemming Information retrieval Automatic text summarization Word count frequency. 
Text summarization provides the users with condensed description of documents and a non redundant presentation of facts found in the document. 
Automatic text summarization has been in existence since 1950. 
The solution to this problem is to combine the information retrieval tools with the automatic text summarization. 
The merits of automatic summarization of text are to control the size,  and prediction of content,  which could identify the relation between summarized text and the main text. 
Sentence selection is considered to be an important step in automatic text summarization. 
The last module is to input the well structured abs tractive summary to near natural and efficient Text to Speech(  TTS)  engine which can be used in real time applications as news summarization reading and remote call handling which summarizes the salient points in meetings. 
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
Multi document summarization Text mining Association rule mining Graph ranking. 
The multi document summarization task entails generating a summary of a collection of textual documents.

in the context of document summarization. 
Nowadays Internet provides access to a huge number of electronic textual documents. 
To ease the knowledge discovery process,  a significant research effort has been devoted to studying and developing automated summarization tools,  which produce a succinct overview of the most relevant document content,  i e,  the summary. 
GraphSum performs better than many stateoftheart approaches,  including those that heavily rely on advanced semantics based models(  e g,  ontologies)  or complex linguistic processing steps. 
The raw textual content is commonly unsuitable for use in item set items et and association rule mining. 
)  to further improve the summarization performance. 
As future work,  we plan to(  i)  adapt and evaluate the proposed summarizer into a multilingual contest(  e g,  the TAC’11 contest. 
In (Kulkarni and Prasad 2010):
This study describes three approaches to Automated Text Summarization using connectionist statures based on. 
Authors have surveyed the current text summarization approaches(  Afantenos et al,  2005; Ledeneva et al,  2008)  their advantages and disadvantages and,  with the goal of identifying summarization techniques most suitable to generic text summarization. 
Over the past half a century,  the problem of text summarization has been addressed from many different perspective,  in various domains and using various paradigms. 
This study intends to investigate Connectionist architecture for the Text Summarization system,  taking into account of existing new developments in adaptive evolving systems. 
We have developed automatic text summarization system with three different approaches. 
Since a lot of interesting work is being done far from the mainstream research in this field,  we have chosen to develop approaches to Text Summarization that we found relevant to future research,  even if they focus only on small details related to a general summarization process and not on building an entire summarization system. 
In this study,  we consider the system of an Automatic Text Summarization as Evolving system which learns incrementally through experience in the environment. 
Despite the successfully developed and used methods of Computational Intelligence(  CI) ,  such as Artificial Neural Networks(  ANN) ,  Fuzzy Systems(  FS) ,  evolutionary computation,  hybrid systems and other methods and techniques,  there are a number of problems while applying these techniques to Text Summarization problem. 
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
This paper presents a method for text summarization based on the gist of a source text that differs from the related ones in Computational Linguistics. 
Those are added to the extract provided that they satisfy summarization requirements,  namely,  gist preservation,  textuality,  relevance,  and compression constraints. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
,  we also address text summarization by using a central proposition of a text. 
By making GistSumm gist based,  we assume it emulates human summarization in that,  when a person summarizes a text,  s he first tries to identify the gist and,  then,  adds information drawn from the text to complement it. 
Although many authors have stressed the need to convey the main idea and to warrant the textuality of the results in automatic summarization. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Although GistSumm also determines the gist of a source text,  its approach is purely statistical,  avoiding the inherent complexity of those deep based ones. 
approaches. 
Using simple statistical measures,  gist is identified as the most important passage of the source text,  conveyed by just one sentence.

8-tSummary evaluation
8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Patel et-al. 2007):
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e. 
So,  evaluation in terms of informativeness is usually preferred. 
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
Degree of Evaluation has been debatable for long time. 
Section gives details of material and evaluation strategies used. 
Through evaluations performed on a single document summarization for English,  Hindi,  Gujarati and Urdu documents,  we show that the method performs equally well regardless of the language. 
Our algorithm tags the sentences making references to previous sentences. 
19. 
This problem has been handled by analyzing the sentence for the presence of certain set of terms or phrases within positional constraints. 
This paper describes an efficient algorithm for language independent generic extractive summarization for single document. 
If a term is repeating more than once in a sentence,  only one instance is considered for computing intermediate sentence weight. 
α and β are constants whose values depend one the language being considered for the summarization. 
respectively. 
Where W(  s)  is an intermediate sentence weight,  WD and WT are the term weights of those sentence terms,  which belong to the document feature vector and the theme feature vector,. 
Degree of information content of a sentence is represented by sentence weight,  which is computed as follows. 
One of the problems of summary generation is the risk of extracting a sentence,  which is not complete by itself as it makes reference to previous sentence(  s). 
3.2 Sentence Reference Index. 
It thus. 
So,  the next step is to carry out sentence analysis and to determine sentence weight.

generates what we call as Sentence Reference Index. 
This index is used to enhance information content of a sentence. 
The intermediate sentence weight W(  s)  is enhanced for those sentences whose following sentences make reference to it. 
This is based on the following hypothesis. 
If more is said(  written)  in the following sentence(  s)  about the contents of the current sentence,  it implies higher importance(  richness)  of content of the current sentence. 
In order to calculate the Sentence Reference Index,  we are maintaining an external table for the words that give the indication for previous sentence reference. 
We have collected a list of such words for English,  Hindi,  Gujarati and Urdu languages. 
This process is repeated recursively updating the tag values appropriately. 
Thus,  after preprocessing we have made the text suitable for extracting important sentences. 
Theme Feature Vector(  For Hindi Documents). 
Title Feature Vector vs. 
Second,  check each word in the dictionary(  vocabulary)  of respective language. 
If word is not found in the dictionary then it is considered to be a name. 
Both of these approaches involve a lot of overhead and the execution of algorithm becomes slow. 
We have used a novel way to handle this issue with satisfactory results. 
We consider only those words as names which are within single double quotes. 
And we enhance the weight of sentence in as described in section. 
Using the threshold as 30% of the highest frequency,  the resulting vector is called the Document Feature Vector. 
For English. 
We have proposed an enhanced feature vector i e. 
Theme feature vector which tells more about the central theme of the document. 
In order to form this,  we extract frequent terms from the title and merge these with the frequent proper nouns vector. 
The resulting vector is termed as Theme Feature Vector. 
This is a significant improvement over title feature vector as used by most of the researchers. 
However,  we can provide this table for other languages as well without any change in algorithm. 
3,  5,  18. 
Examples to substantiate the above hypotheses are presented in Table below. 
Forming theme feature vector for documents which are not in English is somewhat challenging as we have no direct accessibility of proper nouns in the document. 
However,  as said earlier,  we are considering the names in quotes as special nouns and including them into theme feature vector. 
However,  only taking such special nouns as theme words may lead to following two problems. 
The documents not contain quoted names may have empty theme feature vector. 
Even theme feature vector of documents containing quoted names,  may not be. 
We have successfully handled the above problems by applying threshold α on document feature vector and including the top most frequent terms from it in our theme feature vector. 
The title words are included in theme feature vector only if title word appears in Document feature vector above threshold β. 
Initially,  we have considered following criteria. 
λ1 = 50% of highest term frequency λ2 = max of. 
25% of highest term frequency,  2. 
Some examples which support this approach are shown in following Tables. 
Table. 
,  because in many cases the title feature vector is not richly suggestive of the core idea(  s)  of the document whereas the proposed Theme Feature Vector is rich in conveying the central idea(  s)  of the document. 
8.2-tQuality evaluation9-tEvaluation results
8.3-tAsiya, an evaluation toolkit
In (He et-al. 2012):
We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence. 
Due to limited space,  more information can be referred to the toolkit package. 
Table 1 and Table 2 show the ROUGE evaluation results on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 data sets respectively. 
In this study,  we use the standard summarization benchmark data sets DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 for the evaluation. 
Document summarization is of great value to many real world applications,  such as snippets generation for search results and news headlines generation. 
For the sake of efficient optimization,  following(  Yu et al   2008; Cai and He 2012) ,  we formulate the objective function of nonnegative DSDR as follows. 
where β =.

8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
This is a welcome volume for both researchers and teachers who are interested in extending the traditional boundaries of Information Retrieval to include related information access and analytic applications such as summarization,  extraction,  and question answering Text summarization,  which is de ned by the editors as the process of distilling the most important information from a source(  s)  to produce an abridged version for a particular user(  s)  and task(  s)  ” is a technology that has been worked on for more than forty years anda capability that users have long desired. 
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting. 
Classical Approaches CorpusBased Approaches Exploiting DiscourseStructure; KnowledgeRich Approaches Evaluation Methods,  and New SummarizationProblem Areas.Following the general introduction is an excellent piece by Karen Spar ck Jones that provides a framework for understanding the task of summarization and calls for a doable research strategy that should serve to provide useful technology in the near future using what is already known in NLP. 
The introductions are substantive pieces on their own and together with the piece by Spar ck Jones could well serve as a good summarization of the entire book Particularly welcome is the section on Evaluation Methods a topic that requires broader attention if the eld is to provide reliable advances. 
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
In order to make our experiments more relevant,  we have used the evaluation thee valuation framework of a large scale project for evaluating text summarization algorithms. 
“ Text summarization is still an emerging field,  and serious questions remain concerning the appropriate methods and types of evaluation. 
theTIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation Conference(  SUMMAC)  – hereafter referred to as the SUMMAC project for short Mani et al   98. 
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
Here the topic is provided as an input to the summarization system,  and the evaluation seeks to determine whether the ... 
Our text summarization algorithm is based on computing the value of aTFISF(  term frequency – inverse sentence frequency)  measure for each word,  which is an adaptation of the conventional TFIDF(  term frequency – inverse document frequency)  measure of information retrieval. 
document clustering and text summarization. 
The source text has 75 sentences Clearly,  none of the two systems produced perfect summaries,  which is normal,  considering the high degree of difficulty associated with the text summarization task. 
a document clustering algorithm or a text summarization one The document clustering algorithm uses the Auto class algorithm Cheese man et al   88. 
Another categorization can be made between objective or subjective measures of summary quality To evaluate our text summarization algorithm,  we have compared the summaries produced by our system against the summaries produced by algorithms performing the adhoc task of theSUMMAC project. 
In this section we describe the results of an experiment carr ied out to evaluate our text summarization algorithm. 
ThresholdTSISF = percentage threshold * MaxAvgTFISF value The output of the text summarization algorithm consists of all sentences s whose AvgTFISF(  s)  value is greater than or equal to ThresholdTSISF. 
Probably the most important future research is to extend the functionality of the tool so that it can perform other text mining tasks,  mainly text categorization and the discovery of association rules between keywords of documents In addition,  we are currently developing other techniques for text summarization,  based on the use of genetic algorithms. 
In (Hovy et-al. 2006):
The text summarization community has also searched for automatic summary evaluation methods that produce reliable scores that correlate well with human scoring. 
A good automatic summarization evaluation procedure should be able to differentiate good systems from bad ones. 
32 automatic summarization systems participated to create question focused summaries by answering a list of complicated questions from sets of 2550 texts. 
Another important property that a good automated evaluation procedure possesses is that it must show good and consistent correlation across evaluations of different summarization tasks. 
To examine the validity of our method,  we have tested the BE framework and its current implementation thoroughly using previous DUC evaluation results,  namely DUC2002 and 2003,  on single and multi document summarization tasks,  and very short headline generation task. 
Table 2 shows the correlation between BE and ROUGE,  a widely used and recognized automated summarization evaluation method(  Lin and Hovy,  2003). 
BE breakers(  that create individual BE units,  given a text) ,  BE matchers(  that rate the similarity of any two BE units) ,  and BE scorers(  that assign a score to each BE unit individually). 
DUC2005 is the first time that query based summarization has been performed on a large scale. 
50 sets of texts were used in the task. 
In addition,  the best ROUGE parameterization varies with tasks,  thus making it difficult to settle on a particular and consistent parameterization for all summarization tasks. 
In practice,  the evaluation procedure is given a set of system generated summaries and human written reference summaries,  and is required to provide a rank for the systems that created the summaries. 
ROUGE(  Lin and Hovy 2003) ,  the most frequently used automated summary evaluation package,  is closely modeled after BLEU for MT evaluation(  Papineni et al   2001). 
In this paper we describe a framework in which summary evaluation measures can be instantiated and compared,  and we implement a specific evaluation method using very small units of content,  called Basic Elements,  that address some of the shortcomings of ngrams.
