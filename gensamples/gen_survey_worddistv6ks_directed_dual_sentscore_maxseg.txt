Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (GlavaÅ¡ G, Å najder J 2014):
The proposed model is extractive(  summaries are built by extracting sentences from the original texts)  and non focused(  the summarization is not guided by a specific information need). 
We chose these particular kernels because their general forms have intuitive interpretations for event matching and can be easily adjusted to fit our needs for event centered text comparison. 
Furthermore,  considering that numerous textual sources provide information about the same real world events,  the need for aggregating and summarizing the most relevant information has become obvious. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
Text generation patterns can be used,  based on some knowledge about the topic or the information needs of the user. 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
Therefore,  one needs a representation of text which will enable semantic similarity determination between two texts. 
Nevertheless,  it is quite probable that the words expressing the content will exist in the same context or that part of the words used will be identical,  for example,  if different in ections are used. 
Tackling the problem of what kind of information should be used to represent a peer and a model summary in the evaluation of a summary,  one should take into account that the surface appearance of two equivalent pieces of the same semantic content need not be identical as happens in the case of paraphrases Zhou et al   2006. 
In (Hearst 1997):
coding discourse and dialogue phenomena,  and especially coding segment boundaries,  may be inherently more difficult than many previous types of content analysis(  for instance,  dividing newspaper articles based on subject matter) "  and so implies that the levels of agreement needed to indicate good reliability for TextTiling may be justified in being lower. 
First,  Nomoto and Nit ta(  1994)  use too large an interval words because this is approximately the average size needed for their implementation of the blocks version of TextTiling. 
With the increase in importance of multimedia information,  especially in the context of Digital Library projects,  the need for segmentation and summarization of alternative media types is becoming increasingly important. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
According to Mani and May bury(  1999) ,  automatic text summarization takes a partially structured source text from multiple texts written about the same topic,  extracts information content from it,  and presents the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs. 
Thus,  now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust text summarization systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary(  Harabagiu and Lacatusu,  2010,  Yang and Wang,  2008). 
In general,  an abstract can be described as summary comprising concepts ideas taken from the source,  which are then reinterpreted and presented,  in a different form,  whilst an extract is a summary consisting of units of text taken from the source and presented verbatim(  Kutlu,  Cigir,  & Cicekli,  2010). 
In (Moawad IF, Aref M 2012):
The input graph contains the information needed to generate the final text. 
To achieve its task,  the phase accesses the domain ontology,  which contains the information needed in the same domain of RSG to generate the final texts. 
The exponential growth in data increases the need for intelligent filtering and knowledge based approaches to reduce the time needed to absorb the key facts in documents and to avoid drowning in it. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Thus,  there is a need for automatic text summarization for the languages in order to subdue this constantly increasing amount of electronically produced text. 
Precision(  the fraction of the text portions retrieved that are relevant to user s information need)  and recall(  the fraction of the text portions that are relevant to the topic that are successfully retrieved)  are the two performance measure used for determining the quality of the summary. 
This need is usually expressed by a natural language query or,  as in World Wide Web search engines,  by a list of keywords. 
In (Carlson et-al. 2003):
The procedural knowledge available at the EDU level is likely to need further refinement for higher level text spans along the lines of other work which posits a few macro level relations for text segments,  such as Ferrari(  1998)  or Meyer(  1985). 
Yet,  often an appropriate choice of relation for an unseen segment may not be obvious from the current(  rightmost)  unit that needs to be attached. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Although ROUGE takes into account contextual information,  it remains at the word level,  which means we either regard different types of the same word as different or we need to apply(  language dependent)  stemming or lemmatization to remove this effect. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
a pure statistical approach based on HMMs. 
On the other hand,  we expect that the purely statistical HMMbased approach will be more robust to text from different genres. 
Specifically,  a sentence selector builds the final summary by choosing among the candidates,  based on features propagated from the sentence compression method,  features of the candidates themselves,  and features of the present summary state. 
It is currently a middle of the pack system based on recent DUC evaluations â€“ not significantly better or worse than most systems(  Madnani et al,  2007,  Zajic et al,  2006). 
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
Second,  we use two graph based summarization approaches,  Generalized ClueWordSummarizer and PageRank,  to extract sentences as summaries. 
All these approaches used the email thread as a coarse representation of the underlying conversation structure. 
In our recent study(  Carenini et al,  2007) ,  we built a fragment quotation graph to represent an email conversation and developed a ClueWordSummarizer(  CWS)  based on the concept of clue words. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
The second category,  predictive approaches,  includes ranking and classification based methods. 
In classification based methods,  model features are usually derived from human generated summaries,  and are non lexical in nature(  e g,  sentence starting position,  number of topic signatures,  number of unique words). 
Sentences have been ranked by the average word probability,  average TF*IDF score,  and the number of topically related words(  topic signatures in the summarization literature) (  Nenkova and Vanderwende,  2005; Hovy and Lin,  1998; Lin and Hovy,  2000). 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
outperforms keyword based text summarization approaches. 
Nowadays,  corpus based approaches play an important role in text summarization(  Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; Lin & Hovy,  1997; Teufel & Mo ens,  1997; Yeh et al,  2002). 
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
The former,  which does not require training data,  is represented by algorithms ported from the text community,  such as variants of MMR(  Murray et al,  a Riedhammer et al,  a) ,  graph based methods(  Garg et al,  2009,  and concept based methods(  Filatovaand Hatzivassiloglou,  2004; Riedhammer et al,  b Takamura and Okumura,  2009)  Supervised approaches rely on a classi er,  usually a support vector machine(  Burg es,  1998) ,  to predict a binary class label for each input sentence indicating whether it should be included in the summary or not. 
sentence based scoring of relevance and redundancy,  and sub sentence based scoring with implicit redundancy. 
 We compare two approaches for global modeling in summarization. 
In (Shen et-al. 2007):
In this paper,  we present a Conditional Random Fields(  CRF)  based framework to keep the merits of the above two kinds of approaches while avoiding their disadvantages. 
In the past,  extractive summarizers have been mostly based on scoring sentences in the source document based on a set of predefined features Mani and Bloedorn,  1998. 
and graphs based on the similarity of sentences Mihalcea,  2005. 
In (Li et-al. 2015a):
whether or not a sentence is in the summary,  or unsupervised methods such as graph based approaches to rank the sentences. 
Similar to the above method,  here we still focus on measuring the similarity between a bi gram big ram and the topic query,  but based on WordNet. 
Definitions of the extent of the Indian subcontinent differ but it usually includes the core lands of India,  Pakistan,  and Bangladesh the percentage of the correct bi grams big rams(  those in the human reference summaries)  by our proposed selection method and the original ICSI system which justICSI SystemSystemused document ICSI frequency based selection. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
Note that the value of threshold is predetermined based on the percentage of output summary required to be generated. 
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (GlavaÅ¡ G, Å najder J 2014):
In this article,  we present event graphs,  a novel event based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. 
To construct the event graphs,  we combine machine learning and rule based models to extract sentence level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. 
To adequately capture the semantics of events,  we introduce event graphs,  a novel event centered document representation based on sentence level event mentions. 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank â€“ a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
Graph based ranking algorithms like Klein berg s HITS algorithm(  Klein berg,  1999)  or Google s PageRank(  Br in and Page,  1998)  have been successfully used in citation analysis,  social networks,  and the analysis of the link structure of the World Wide Web. 
In short,  agraphbased ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph,  by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph,  rather than relying only on local vertexspeci c information. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
Define two sets S = Ï•,  S si i = 1,  2,  â€¦,  N,  and initialize the ranking score of each sentence to its graph based ranking score,  i e. 
Use a graph based ranking algorithm to rank all the sentences in the documents where the original query is used. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Nowadays,  corpus based approaches play an important role in text summarization(  Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; Lin & Hovy,  1997; Teufel & Mo ens,  1997; Yeh et al,  2002). 
outperforms keyword based text summarization approaches. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
Latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  is a mathematical technique for extracting and inferring relations of expected contextual usage of words in passages of discourse(  Deer wester et al,  1990; Landau er et al,  1998). 
In (0017):
In existing unsupervised methods,  Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  is used for sentence selection sentences election. 
Unsupervised methods do not require training data such as human made summaries to train the summarizer(  Nomoto & Yuji,  2001; Buckley & Walz,  1999; Gong & Liu,  2001)  Recently,  many generic document summarization methods using Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  have been proposed(  Gong & Liu,  2001; Li,  Li,  & Wu,  2006; Yeh et al,  2005; Zha,  2002). 
The second method uses a latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to semantically identify important sentences for summary creations. 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
Simulation experiments suggest that this technique is useful because it moves away from a purely keyword based method of textual information extraction and its associated limitations. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
evaluation frameworks uses statistical measures of similarity based on ngrams of words,  4 although it supports different kinds of analysis,  ranging from ngram to semantic Hovy et al   b. 
A number of different intermediate representations of summaries information have been introduced in existing summarization evaluation literature,  ranging from automatically extracted snippets to human decided sub sentential portions of text. 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
Automatic summarization Complex networks Network measurements Sentence extraction Summary informativeness. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (Ferreira et-al. 2014):
The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an unsupervised generic summarization system,  that makes linguistic treatment of the input text by performing co reference resolution and discourse analysis,  besides using statistical and semantic similarities,  as in all previous work in the literature. 
The 2002 conference was the last one that proposed the contest to create generic multi document summaries. 
In general,  multi document summarization is either generic(  also termed extractive) (  Alguliev,  Aliguliyev,  & Hajirahimova,  a)  or query based(  Luo,  Zhuang,  He,  & Shi,  2013). 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Section 2 presents the different text feature parameters,  Section 3 is about the proposed automatic summarization model,  Section 4 shows the experimental results and finally Section 5 presents conclusions and future work. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
â€¢ An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;â€¢ A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;â€¢ A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
â€¢ The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The DPP models outperform the baselines in most cases furthermore,  there is a signi cant boost in performance due to the use of DPP maximum likelihood training in place of logistic regression. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
BAYESUM leverages the common case in which multiple documents are relevant to a single query. 
Query based extractive text summarization. 
In query based text summarization. 
If users create query words the way they create for information retrieval,  then the query based summary generation would become generic summarization. 
In (Otterbacher et-al. 2009):
However,  in our approach,  answers are extracted from a set of multiple documents rather than on a documentbydocument basis. 
A key challenge for passage retrieval for QA is that,  when attempting to retrieve answers to questions from a set of documents published by multiple sources over time(  e g. 
Our method is a query based extension of the LexRanksummarization method introduced in(  Erk an and Radev,  2004). 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  modeled extractive document summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
A good summary,  as whole,  is expected to be the one with extensive coverage of the focuses presented in documents,  minimum redundancy,  and smooth connection among sentences. 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  represented each sentence with a set of conceptual units and formalized the extractive summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
Takamura and Okumura(  a)  represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint(  MCKP). 
4.11-tSummarization of documents through a progressive technique for selection of sentences
4.12-tEvaluation of sentence scoring methods for extractive summarization of text
In (Ferreira et-al. 2013):
Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive. 
These techniques are mainly used into abs tractive summarization,  but they may be adapted for extractive ones. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
Although extractive summarization can produce texts that have cohesion and coherence problems,  many systems have been proven to yield summaries whose informative level is satisfactory. 
A graph,  or network,  is a representation that may capture text structure in various ways,  being therefore suitable for extractive summarization. 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded. 
It discovers and exploits association rules to represent the correlations among multiple terms that have been neglected by previous approaches. 
4.14-tIncorporating various levels of language analysis for tackling redundancy in text summarization
4.15-tEvolutionary optimization algorithm for summarizing multiple documents
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005). 
(  1)  content coverage,  summary should contain salient sentences that cover the main content of the documents(  2)  diversity,  summaries should not contain multiple sentences that convey(  carry)  the same information and(  3)  length,  summary should be bounded in length. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
This paper presents GraphSum,  a general purpose graph based summarizer that combines the association rules that were extracted from the analyzed documents in a graph based model in order to consider the correlations among multiple terms during the summarization process. 
Unlike all of the above mentioned approaches,  our summarizer discovers association rules from the analyzed document to also represent the correlations among multiple terms in the graph based model. 
A parallel effort has been devoted to using clustering algorithms for summarizing documents. 
In (Song et-al. 2011):
In this section,  we propose a fuzzy evolutionary optimization model to solve the problem of data clustering. 
Extractive summarization Topics estimation Unsupervised categorization Fuzzy evolutionary optimization Normalized Google distance. 
This paper proposes a fuzzy evolutionary optimization modeling(  FEOM)  and its applications to unsupervised categorization and extractive summarization. 
4.16-tSummarization of multiple documents using a hybrid machine learning model
4.17-tImproving clustering at sentence-level with the help of ranking-based technique for theme-based summarization
In (Yang et-al. 2014):
Recall that our goal is to obtain more accurate sentence clusters and generate good summaries in theme based summarization. 
Thus,  good sentence clusters are the guarantee of good summaries in theme based summarization. 
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters. 
Ranking based clustering Sentence clustering Theme based summarization. 
Ranking based clustering framework shows the best performance,  it further presents ranking distribution of documents and terms can help generate more accurate sentence clusters. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
Second,  we believe that our results represent a comprehensive and replicable study,  which demonstrates the effectiveness of a structured,  theme based approach to multi document summarization. 
We first discuss a total of six different sentence extraction methods(  EM1â€“ EM6)  which correspond to the four baseline topic representation techniques(  TR1â€“TR4) ,  introduced in Section 2,  plus the two topic theme based representations based on TR5 introduced in Section 3.16 For ease of exposition,  we will refer to the graph based theme representation as TH1 and the linked list based theme representation as TH2. 
We believe that these results prove the benefits of using the theme based topic representation for multi document summarization. 
4.18-tStatistical and linguistic based summarization system for multiple documents
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
All features are computed over primitives,  syntactic,  linguistic,  or knowledge based information units extracted from the sentences. 
4.19-tMulti-document summarization based information retrieval using event graphs
4.20-textractive summarization of single documents through genetic operators and guided local search
4.21-t Topic-aspect based summarization through selection of groups
In (Fang et-al. 2015):
Many extraction based summarization methods have been proposed in the past years. 
As a result,  controls the selection of groups of,  as well as the groups of features,  which represents the preferred aspects in our summarization task. 
With the construction of feature groups,  a latent variable is utilized to control the selection of them. 
4.22-tSummarization of multiple documents based on social Folksonomy by analyzing semantically
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
Finally,  we create a summary of multiple documents by analyzing the importance of each word and its semantic relatedness to others. 
4.23-tOther text summarization approaches
4.23.1-tLearning-based approach for summarizing related sentences
4.23.2-tSemantic role labeling with minimal resources
In (Khan et-al. 2015):
In this framework,  contents of the source documents are represented by predicate argument structures by employing semantic role labeling. 
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. 
Our work,  in contrast,  aims to treat this limitation by using semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique to build semantic representation from the document text automatically. 
4.23.3-tSummarizing single documents through nested tree structure
4.23.4-tTwo-level sparse representation model for summarization of multiple documents
In (Liu et-al. 2015):
We design a two level sparse representation model to extract multi document summarization The original document set is sparsely represented by summary sentences. 
two level sparse representation model age,  sparsity and diversity together in multi document summarization. 
Similar to(  Yang et al   2013) ,  the two level sparse representation model we introduced is NPhard,  we use simulated annealing algorithm to get the summarization To our knowledge,  this is the rst paper that utilizes cover. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
This paper presents GraphSum,  a general purpose graph based summarizer that combines the association rules that were extracted from the analyzed documents in a graph based model in order to consider the correlations among multiple terms during the summarization process. 
Frequent item sets,  which represent correlations among terms,  are extracted from a transactional representation of the document collection and combined in a graph based model. 
In (Yang et-al. 2013):
We have leveraged the dictionary learning for sparse representation model to construct the summary and to represent the image. 
We have discovered that the image collection summarization problem can be interpreted straightforwardly with the dictionary learning for sparse representation model under the SIFT BoW framework. 
We have explicitly reformulated the problem of automatic image summarization by using an sparse representation model and the simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization function more effectively. 
In (Li et-al. 2015a):
Given the recent success of the continuous representation for words,  we propose to use an unsupervised method to induce dense real valued low dimensional word embedding,  and then use the inner product as ameasure of semantic similarity between two strings In the word embedding model,  every word can be represented by a vector w We define the similarity between two sequences S = x 1,  x 2,  x k and sequence S = y 1,  y 2,  y l as the average pairwise similarity between any two words in them. 
Second,  to estimate the importance of the oft he bi grams big rams,  in addition to the internal features based on the test documents(  e g,  document frequency,  bi gram big ram positions) ,  we propose to extract features by leveraging multiple external resources(  such as word embedding from additional corpus,  Wikipedia,  Dbpedia,  WordNet,  SentiWordNet).

In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
A novel multi document summarization model based on the budgeted median problem proposed in Takamura and Okumura(  b). 
One of the advantages of this representation is that MCKP can directly model whether each concept in the given documents is covered by the summary or not,  and can dispense with rather counterintuitive approaches such as giving penalty to each pair of two similar sentences. 
The facility location model adds features to the pmedian model,  and the linear representation model jumps out of the idea of clustering,  and modify the representation method. 
4.23.5-tSparse-coding based reader-aware summarization system for multiple documents
In (Fung P, Ngai G 2006):
We propose a system of segmenting multiple multilingual documents into different topics or stories and then summarizing these stories. 
A nal meta summarizer is used to summarize multiple documents using the HMSM state labels. 
This article presents a multi document,  multilingual,  theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion(  story ow). 
For multi document summa rization,  the state labels of individual documents are used to group multiple summaries together into a single meta summary,  greatly simplifying the pro cess. 
In (CR92):
We propose a new MDS paradigm called reader aware multi document summarization(  RAMDS)  Speci cally,  a set of reader comments associated with the news reports are also collected. 
We name such aparadigm of extension as reader aware multi document summarization(  RAMDS)  We give a real example taken from a data set collected by us to illustrate the importance of RAMDS. 
We propose a new MDS paradigm called reader aware multi document summarization(  RAMDS). 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
In this paper,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system,  called FoDoSu(  Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization) ,  that employs the tag clusters used in Folksonomy systems to detect key sentences in multiple documents. 
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
In (Radev et-al. 2001):
We will introduce an e ective search engine to summarize clusters of related web pages which provide more contextual and summary information to help users explore the retrieval result more e ciently We describe in this paper a system,  WebInEssence,  which blends the traditional information retrieval technology with advanced document clustering,  document recommendation,  and multi document summarization technology in an integrated framework Text summarization is the process of selecting the most salient information in one or more textual documents. 
Both single document summarization for a single URL and multiple document summarization for a cluster of URLs are supported in our system More related work can be found on the Extractor web site. 
Summarization relies on the principles of text redundancy and unevenly distributed information content to extract highly informative snippets(  often keywords or sentences)  from a document which can be read by the user in lieu of the original document(  s)  In WebInEssence,  we have adopted an approach to summarization of multiple documents called centroid based summarization(  Radev et al,  2000). 
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
This is the focus of our work reported here,  including the necessity to eliminate redundancy among the information content of multiple related documents. 
More recently,  single document summarization systems provide an automated generic abstract or a query relevant summary(  TIPSTER,  a). 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
We expect that theme based representations can be used to organize topic relevant information from multiple sources,  extracted from either, (  1)  a single sentence, (  2)  a cluster of sentences, (  3)  a discourse fragment,  or even(  4)  a cluster of documents. 
In Section 2,  we considered five different baseline topic representations that use terms(  TR1) ,  relations(  TR2) ,  document segments(  TR3) ,  sentence clusters(  TR4) ,  or semantic frames generated from multiple different documents(  TR5). 
In our work,  we have considered both, (  1)  component based evaluations,  which evaluated each phase in the creation of a multi document summary separately,  and(  2)  intrinsic evaluations,  which evaluate the quality of each individual multi document summary generated by a summarization system. 
4.23.6-tSummarization of multiple documents through recursive neural networks based ranking approach
In (Cao et-al. 2015a):
In addition,  recursive neural networks are used to automatically learn ranking features over the tree,  with handcrafted feature vectors of words as inputs. 
We develop a Ranking framework upon Recursive Neural Networks(  R2N2)  to rank sentences for multi document summarization. 
To this end,  we develop a ranking framework upon recursive neural networks(  R2N2)  to rank sentences for multi document summarization. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
Text summarization with neural networks. 
This method involves training the neural networks to learn the types of sentences that should be included in the summary. 
BAYESUM leverages the common case in which multiple documents are relevant to a single query. 
Multi document extractive summarization deals with extraction of summarized information from multiple texts written about the same topic. 
4.23.7-tGraph-based extractive summarization by considering importance, non-redundancy and coherence
In (Parveen and Strube 2015):
We propose a graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization which considers importance,  non redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. 
Therefore,  in our work,  computing importance,  non redundancy and coherence is tightly integrated and taken care of simultaneously Our graph based summarization technique has the further advantage of being completely unsupervised We apply our graph based summarization technique to scienti c articles from the journal PLOS Medicine,  a high impact open access journal from the medical domain. 
Hence,  we optimize importance,  non redundancy and coherence simultaneously. 
4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Several real world machine learning applications involve hierarchy based categorization of topics for a set of objects. 
Our approach is based on sub modular maximization and mixture learning,  which has been successfully used in applications such as document summarization(  Lin,  2012)  and image summarization(  Tschiatschek et al,  2014) ,  but has never been applied to topic identification tasks or,  more generally,  DAG summarization. 
Given a collection of articles spanning different topics,  but with similar titles,  automatically generate a disambiguation page for those titles using the Wikipedia category hierarchy as a topic DAG. 
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,  increasing the quality of the updates. 
Our system predicts sentence salience in the context of a large scale event,  such as a disaster,  and integrates these predictions into a clustering based multi document summarization system. 
The AP+SALIENCE model is better able to find salient updates earlier on for the disaster domain,  this is an especially important quality of the model. 
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
This is the focus of our work reported here,  including the necessity to eliminate redundancy among the information content of multiple related documents. 
Specifically,  we are constructing sets of 10 documents,  which either contain a snapshot of an event from multiple sources or the unfoldment of an event over time. 
4.23.12-tPhrase-based compressive cross-language summarization
4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In (Graham 2015):
An analysis of evaluation of summarization metrics was provided with an evaluation of BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE. 
In total,  therefore,  when employing ROUGE for the evaluation of summarization systems,  there are 192(  8 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2)  possible system level variants to choose from. 
Automatic metrics of summarization evaluation have their origins in machine translation(  MT) ,  with ROUGE(  Lin and Hovy,  2003) ,  the first and still most widely used automatic summarization metric,  comprising an adaption of the BLEU score(  Papineni et al,  2002). 
4.24-tPro and Cons
5-tComparison of recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In (CR100):
In light of this,  Text Summarization(  TS)  is of great help since its main aim is to produce a condensed new text containing a significant portion of the information in the original text(  s)  The process of summarization can be divided into three stages. 
Moreover,  in order to decide which of the new sentences should be included in the abs tractive summary,  an extractive text summarization approach is developed(  i e,  COMPENDIUM) ,  so that the most relevant abs tractive sentence scan sentences can be selected and extracted. 
This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization

8-tSummary evaluation
8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Patel et-al. 2007):
So,  evaluation in terms of informativeness is usually preferred. 
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e. 
Thus,  after preprocessing we have made the text suitable for extracting important sentences. 
So,  the next step is to carry out sentence analysis and to determine sentence weight. 
In (Banerjee et-al. 2015):
Further,  manual evaluation by human judges shows that our technique produces summaries with acceptable linguistic quality and high informativeness. 
In manual evaluation,  our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and readability. 
Hence,  we introduce two factors â€“ Informativeness(  I(  p Cj i) )  and Linguistic quality(  LQ(  p Cj i) ). 
for automatic evaluation of summaries(  compared against human written model summaries)  as it has been proven effective in measuring qualities of summaries and correlates well to human judgments.

Others considered previously selected patterns in item set items et evaluation to reduce model redundancy. 
Experimental results,  performed on the DUCâ€™04 document collection by means of ROUGE toolkit,  show that the proposed approach achieves better performance than a large set of competitors. 
8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
Our text summarization algorithm is based on computing the value of aTFISF(  term frequency â€“ inverse sentence frequency)  measure for each word,  which is an adaptation of the conventional TFIDF(  term frequency â€“ inverse document frequency)  measure of information retrieval. 
However,  the textual,  unstructured nature of documents makes these two text mining tasks considerably more difficult than their data mining counterparts. 
In (Dunlavy et-al. 2007):
We demonstrate the improved performance by a series of experiments using standard test sets from the Document Understanding Conferences(  DUC)  as measured by the best known automatic metric for summarization system evaluation,  ROUGE. 
Information retrieval Latent semantic indexingClusteringSummarizationText processing Sentence trimming. 
In many of the DUC evaluations,  similar lead sentence summaries have been used as baselines,  representing a summarization approach requiring minimal text and or natural language processing. 
In (Hovy et-al. 2006):
The text summarization community has also searched for automatic summary evaluation methods that produce reliable scores that correlate well with human scoring. 
A good automatic summarization evaluation procedure should be able to differentiate good systems from bad ones. 
32 automatic summarization systems participated to create question focused summaries by answering a list of complicated questions from sets of 2550 texts.
