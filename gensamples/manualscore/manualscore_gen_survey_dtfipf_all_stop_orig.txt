We have developed automatic text summarization system with three different approaches. 0 0
In (Huang et-al. 2010):
(  4)  Text Cohesion(  text coh). 0 0
Terms are clustered based on the three types of relations among them,  i e. 0 0
Information is rather conceptual,  but a summary is the text written in a language. 0 0
} 1 2 n T = t t t,  from documents D based on term co occurrence statistics provided with the query context. 0 0
First,  the core terms based text representation seems work well for the task of query oriented summarization. 0 0
In particular,  we formulate four objective functions,  namely information coverage,  significance,  redundancy and text coherence. 0 0
Therefore,  the generated summary should be the readable and comprehensible text,  rather than simply a heap of important but disconnected words or phrases. 0 0

It uses the weighting terms representation of the textual units. 0 1
The proposed generic text summarization model is presented in Section 3. 0 1
► We model unsupervised generic text summarization as an optimization problem. 0 1
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Huang et-al. 2010):
It obviously outperforms the Centroid based approach. 0 0
a cluster of semantically or statistically related core terms). 0 0
a cluster of semantically or statistically related core terms). 0 0
CoreTerm and Centroid represent another two non optimization approaches that evaluate terms and selects sentences based on term importance. 0 0
Terms are clustered based on the three types of relations among them,  i e. 0 0
Consequently,  the objective functions are then formulated based on T and C. 0 0
Three approaches have been proposed to cope with the multi objective optimization problem. 0 0
They measure the possible summaries based on the identified core terms and main topics(  i e. 0 0
The potential of optimization based document summarization models has not been well explored to date. 0 0
Otherwise,  the optimization solutions will degenerate to the traditional non optimization based(  e g. 0 0
These functions measure the possible summaries based on the identified core terms and main topics(  i e. 0 0
} 1 2 n T = t t t,  from documents D based on term co occurrence statistics provided with the query context. 0 0
First,  the core terms based text representation seems work well for the task of query oriented summarization. 0 0
Section 3 introduces query sensitive term ranking and clustering and proposes an optimization model based on it. 0 0
Since this algorithm utilizes both linguistic and statistical relations,  the more reliable clustering results can be expected. 0 0
Then the terms in documents are evaluated according to their biases to seed terms based on the probability distribution of co occurrence. 0 0
Considering their applicability to the automatic summarization task,  we just experiment with the first two approaches in this pilot study. 0 0
Most of the stateofchart summarization systems are based on extracting the most salient and non redundant sentences to composite the final summaries. 0 0
semantic relations provided in WordNet,  similarities based on JensenShannon divergence,  and the point wise mutual information between a pair of terms. 0 0
The encouraging results indicate that the multi objective optimization based framework for document summarization is truly a promising research direction. 0 0
It is worth noting that a real optimization based summarization method is different from the existing non optimization based methods in two remarkable aspects. 0 1
Then,  an algorithm based on stack decoder was developed to search for the best combination of the sentences that maximized the sum of the scores subject to the length constraint. 0 0
Three algorithms were presented and evaluated,  including a greedy approximate method,  a dynamic programming approach based on solutions to the knapsack problem,  and an exact algorithm that used an integer linear programming formulation of the problem. 0 0
Different from previous work which focused on single objective optimization,  we explicitly define multiple summary evaluation criteria and formulate them as separate objective functions which are measured based on query sensitive core terms and main topics built from core term clusters. 0 0
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
In our work,  we consider two topic structures based on themes. 1 1
(  25 topics were selected at random. 1 1
Discovery of topic relevant information. 1 0
The first four methods are based on topic representations as described in Section 2. 0
We evaluated the quality of sentence extraction based on different representations of topics. 1 1

Query focused summarization Query expansion Graph based ranking. 1 0
Use the newly expanded query to perform graph based ranking algorithm again for sentence ranking. 1 1
In Section 3,  we present in detail our graph based summarization algorithm combined with query expansion. 1 1
Use a graph based ranking algorithm to rank all the sentences in the documents where the original query is used. 1 1
This query expansion method is combined in the graph based summarizer as another baseline system(  named as Synonym baseline). 1 1
Define two sets S = ϕ,  S si i = 1,  2,  …,  N,  and initialize the ranking score of each sentence to its graph based ranking score,  i e. 0 0
In this paper,  we propose a query expansion algorithm used in the graph based ranking approach for query focused multi document summarization. 1 0

4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Murdock 2006):
Other tasks such as information extraction and machine translation operate on sentences,  either using them as training data,  or as the unit of input or output(  or both) ,  and may benefit from sentence retrieval to build a training corpus,  or as a post processing step. 0.5 0
Tasks such as question answering,  summarization,  novelty detection,  and information provenance make use of a sentence retrieval module as a preprocessing step. 1 1
The performance of these systems is dependent on the quality of the sentence retrieval module. 1 1
We propose several solutions to the problem of sentence retrieval,  and investigate these solutions the application areas of sentence retrieval for question answering,  novelty detection,  and information provenance. 1 1
Sentence Retrieval is the task of retrieving a relevant sentence in response to a query,  a question,  or a reference sentence. 1 1
We show that the family of language modeling approaches,  which includes statistical translation models,  is not effective for discriminating between sentences that use the same vocabulary to express the same information,  and sentences that use the same vocabulary to express new information. 0 1
Finally,  we demonstrate a conditional model for sentence retrieval for question answering,  and show that it outperforms both the translation approaches and the baseline language modeling approach. 1 1
In this thesis we begin by demonstrating that because sentences are much smaller than documents,  the performance of typical document retrieval systems on the retrieval of sentences is significantly worse. 1 0
We show that statistical translation models are appropriate for tasks where the sentence to be retrieved has many terms in common with the query,  but still benefits from the addition of related terms and synonyms. 1 1
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 1 0
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 0 0
As a document concept model,  DCL has the following properties. 0 0
We now describe how to build the lattice from source documents. 1 0
Following our work in DUC 2005 and 2006,  we proposed a document concept lattice(  DCL)  model and the corresponding algorithm for summarization. 1 0
Answers appear frequently in the document set might be considered to be more crucial in understanding the source texts. 0 0
As such,  introduce a new data structure,  the document concept lattice,  that compactly represents such hanging structures. 1 1
How does one judge the content of a text. 0 0
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 1 0
Once words that represent unified concepts in the documents are linked,  we represent the sources as a document concept lattice(  DCL). 1 1
• The tests on DUC 2005 and 2006 indicate that both concept and DCL have significant contributions to the performance of text summarization. 1 1
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 0 1

8-tSummary evaluation
8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Hovy et-al. 2006):
A good automatic summarization evaluation procedure should be able to differentiate good systems from bad ones. 1 1
They show an increased correlation with human summary evaluation scores,  using a somewhat nonstandard measure. 1 1
Table 2 shows the correlation between BE and ROUGE,  a widely used and recognized automated summarization evaluation method(  Lin and Hovy,  2003). 1 1
This section describes an overall framework in which various implementations of automated summary content evaluation methods can be housed and compared. 1 0
The text summarization community has also searched for automatic summary evaluation methods that produce reliable scores that correlate well with human scoring. 1 1
ROUGE(  Lin and Hovy 2003) ,  the most frequently used automated summary evaluation package,  is closely modeled after BLEU for MT evaluation(  Papineni et al   2001). 1 1
Another important property that a good automated evaluation procedure possesses is that it must show good and consistent correlation across evaluations of different summarization tasks. 1 1
Experience in Machine Translation and automated speech recognition has shown the great value of an automated evaluation measure for rapid system growth and improvement(  Papineni et al,  2001). 1 1
In practice,  the evaluation procedure is given a set of system generated summaries and human written reference summaries,  and is required to provide a rank for the systems that created the summaries. 1 1
Lin and DemnerFushman(  2005)  recently developed POURPRE,  in which fragments are given an intrinsic score based on their innate informativeness,  computed by measuring the information content of individual words. 1 1
In this paper we describe framework in which various automated summary content evaluation methods can be situated,  and we implement a specific variant that uses rather short fragments we call Basic Elements(  BEs). 1 1
In this paper we describe a framework in which summary evaluation measures can be instantiated and compared,  and we implement a specific evaluation method using very small units of content,  called Basic Elements,  that address some of the shortcomings of ngrams. 1 0
Through shown to correlate well with human judgments,  ROUGE considers fragments,  of various lengths,  to be equally important,  a factor that rewards low informativeness fragments,  such as of the,  unfairly to relative high informativeness ones,  such as person names. 1 1
To examine the validity of our method,  we have tested the BE framework and its current implementation thoroughly using previous DUC evaluation results,  namely DUC2002 and 2003,  on single and multi document summarization tasks,  and very short headline generation task. 1 1
BEF. 0 0
As part of evaluating a summary automatically,  it is usual to determine how much of the contents of one or more human produced ideal summaries it contains. 1 1
BEF reifies embedded tentative nodes that express semantic subject or object with semantic nodes and performs extraction. 1 0
For a propositional phrase,  the head is related to its governing element by its preposition(  e g,  sanction against Libya produces a BE sanction | Libya | against). 0 0
For embedded clauses,  main verbs are related to the modifying verbs. 0 0
BEF extracts BEs from Mini par(  Lin,  1995)  dependency parse trees in which word relations are labeled as subj(  subject) ,  obj(  object) ,  comp(  complement) ,  mod(  modifier) ,  etc   Word pairs with their dependency relation are extracted to form a BE. 1 0
Processing Mini par parse information involves converting compound nouns and verbal idioms,  such as turn over'  and Secretary General' ,  to single tree nodes. 0 1
In particular,  some breakers provide relations as part of the triples and others do not. 0 1
These breakers produce slightly different results(  the common overlap is approximately 40%). 0 1
Each breaker accepts a sentence as input and produces a list of BEs by decomposing parse trees using hand built cutting rules. 0 1

In the present implementation,  each BE gets exactly 1 point for each reference summary it participates in. 0.5

We have not experimented with different weights based on words information content,  etc,  although one can obviously do so. 0 0
