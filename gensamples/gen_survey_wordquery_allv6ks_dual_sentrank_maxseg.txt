Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Hearst 1997):
With the increase in importance of multimedia information,  especially in the context of Digital Library projects,  the need for segmentation and summarization of alternative media types is becoming increasingly important. 
Salton et al  (  1996)  have recognized the need for multi paragraph multipara graph units in the automatic creation of hypertext links as well as theme generation(  this work is discussed in Section 5). 
First,  Nomoto and Nit ta(  1994)  use too large an interval words because this is approximately the average size needed for their implementation of the blocks version of TextTiling. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Thus,  there is a need for automatic text summarization for the languages in order to subdue this constantly increasing amount of electronically produced text. 
Precision(  the fraction of the text portions retrieved that are relevant to user s information need)  and recall(  the fraction of the text portions that are relevant to the topic that are successfully retrieved)  are the two performance measure used for determining the quality of the summary. 
We present an approach of identifying the most prominent text sentences using various shallow linguistic features,  taking degree of connective ness among the text units into consideration so as to minimize the poorly linked sentences in the resulting summary. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
Text generation patterns can be used,  based on some knowledge about the topic or the information needs of the user. 
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (0079):
Coherent text is characterized by various types of cohesive links that facilitate text comprehension(  Halliday and Has an,  1976). 
This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non discourse features(  Miltsakaki and Kukich,  2000). 
The use of rare words or technical terminology for example can make text difficult to read for certain audience types(  CollinsThompson and Call an,  2004; Sch warm Schwa rm and Ostendorf,  2005; Elhadad and Sutaria,  2007). 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
systems(  4) ,  types(  3) ,  solutions(  3) ,  minimal(  3) ,  linear(  2) ,  in equations(  2) ,  algorithms(  2). 
Upper bounds for components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given. 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
Although ROUGE takes into account contextual information,  it remains at the word level,  which means we either regard different types of the same word as different or we need to apply(  language dependent)  stemming or lemmatization to remove this effect. 
In (Carlson et-al. 2003):
Thus,  our approach contributes to the community quite differently from detailed analyses of specific discourse phenomena in depth,  such as anaphoric relations(  Gar side et al,  1997)  or style types(  Leech et al,  1997)  ; analysis of a single text from multiple perspectives(  Mann and Thompson,  1992)  ; or illustrations of a theoretical model on a single representative text(  Brit ton Britt on and Black,  1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch,  1983). 
The annotators hired to build the corpus were all professional language analysts with prior experience in other types of data annotation. 
textual organization,  span,  and same unit(  used to link parts of units separated by embedded units or spans). 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Although GistSumm also determines the gist of a source text,  its approach is purely statistical,  avoiding the inherent complexity of those deep based ones. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2012):
In this paper we present a multi document summarizer that combines the knowledge provided by an itemsetbased model with a statistical evaluator,  based on tfidf statistics,  to select the most representative and not redundant sentences. 
ItemSum is a novel summarizer that selects the most representative sentences based on both their coverage of an itemsetbased model and their single word statistical relevance. 
Unlike previous approaches,  it exploits an entropy based heuristics to drive the mining process and select the most informative yet not redundant item sets without the need of a post pruning step. 
In (Rush et-al. 2015):
To test the effectiveness of this approach we run extensive comparisons with multiple abs tractive and extractive baselines,  including traditional syntax based systems,  integer linear program constrained systems,  information retrieval style approaches,  as well as statistical phrase based machine translation. 
This approach to summarization,  which we call AttentionBased Summarization(  ABS) ,  incorporates less linguistic structure than comparable abs tractive summarization approaches,  but can easily scale to train on a large amount of data. 
Finally,  we use a phrase based statistical machine translation system trained on Gigaword to produce summaries,  MOSES+(  Koehn et al,  2007). 
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
These categories of ngrams are based on statistical criteria and are used to describe how noise can deteriorate the performance of our method as a function of the methodology parameters. 
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
The method is based on ngram graphs even though it provides support for other histogram based approaches. 
In (Bing et-al. 2015):
Different from existing abstraction based approaches,  our method first constructs a pool of concepts and facts represented by phrases from the input documents. 
The abstractivebased approaches gather information across sentence boundary,  and hence have the potential to cover more content in a more concise manner. 
Many existing extraction based and compression based MDS approaches could be regarded as special cases under our framework. 
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting. 
Classical Approaches CorpusBased Approaches Exploiting DiscourseStructure; KnowledgeRich Approaches Evaluation Methods,  and New SummarizationProblem Areas.Following the general introduction is an excellent piece by Karen Spar ck Jones that provides a framework for understanding the task of summarization and calls for a doable research strategy that should serve to provide useful technology in the near future using what is already known in NLP. 
The framework is based on understanding the essential context factors of Input(  form,  subject,  unit) ,  Purpose(  situation,  audience,  use) ,  and Output(  material,  format,  style). 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Second,  we give an overview of event based approaches to information retrieval. 
Third,  we provide an overview of event based approaches to text summarization. 
Furthermore,  the results suggest that similar event based approaches could be used to address closely related NLP tasks such as text simplification. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
As mentioned in Section 1,  motivated by the success of PageRanklike ranking algorithms in webpage ranking,  a number of graph based approaches have been applied to automatic text summarization. 
We use the graph based ranking algorithm similar to the topic sensitive LexRank in Otterbacher et al  (  2005)  as our first step to rank sentences in the documents,  which is also used for comparison as our baseline without query expansion. 
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):

Second,  we give an overview of event based approaches to information retrieval. 
Third,  we provide an overview of event based approaches to text summarization. 
The best performance on the anchor extraction task was achieved by the systems based on rather different approaches. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
Five of these topic representations have been published before in the literature,  while the sixth and seventh representations are novel approaches based on a new type of TR known as a topic theme. 
In general,  we have found that more articulated topic representations such as the theme based representations we introduced in this work provide for multi document summaries that are more representative and more coherent than summaries generated using less structured topic representations(  such as the bagofterms,  ” and bagofrelations based approaches introduced in TR1 and TR2,  respectively. 
In this article,  we describe five previously known topic representations and introduce two novel representations of topics based on topic themes. 
In (Wang and Li 2012):
we first order the clusters topics according to their importance(  we just simply order the clusters topics based on their sizes empirically). 
The centroid based summarization usually includes the sentences of the highest similarities with all the other sentences in the documents into the summary,  which is good since these sentences deliver the majority of information contained in the documents,  however the redundancy needs to be further removed and the subtopics in the documents are hard to detect. 
LSA and NMF are both factorization based techniques which extract the semantic structure and hidden topics in the documents and select the sentences representing each topic as the summary. 
In (Huang et-al. 2010):
These functions measure the possible summaries based on the identified core terms and main topics(  i e. 
They measure the possible summaries based on the identified core terms and main topics(  i e. 
Different from previous work which focused on single objective optimization,  we explicitly define multiple summary evaluation criteria and formulate them as separate objective functions which are measured based on query sensitive core terms and main topics built from core term clusters. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
The graph based methods first construct a graph representing the sentence relationships at different granularities and then evaluate the topic biased saliency of the sentences based on the graph. 
Tao et al  (  2008)  have designed word based and sentence based association networks(  WAN and SAN for short,  respectively)  and proposed word and sentence weighting approaches based on how much co occurrence information they contain,  and applied to text summarization. 
Many approaches have been proposed for text summarization based on the diversity. 
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
in the former,  it is the sentence that corresponds to the most significant distribution of keywords in the latter,  it is that whose frequency distinguishes it as the most representative of the source text,  similarly to the way a topic or a search phrase is derived. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
Graph based ranking algorithms like Klein berg s HITS algorithm(  Klein berg,  1999)  or Google s PageRank(  Br in and Page,  1998)  have been successfully used in citation analysis,  social networks,  and the analysis of the link structure of the World Wide Web. 
In short,  agraphbased ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph,  by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph,  rather than relying only on local vertexspeci c information. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
Query focused summarization Query expansion Graph based ranking. 
Recently,  graph based ranking algorithms have been successfully used in text summarization(  Erk an and Radev,  2004,  Mihalcea and Tarau,  2004; Wan et al,  a,  Wan et al,  b). 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
There are other surface based approaches that address gist preservation in both mono and multi document summarization. 
Indeed,  if we discourse analyze the sample text based on the RST Theory. 
Similarly to the other deep based work,  our system can also produce various summaries for the same source text,  for distinct strategies may be corresponding to varied choices of information units or discourse relations. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Sections 3 Modified corpus based approach,  4 LSA give a detail description of our proposed approaches. 
Both approaches concentrate on single document summarization and generate indicative,  2 extract based summaries. 
In (Parveen and Strube 2015):
Many summarization approaches focus on extracting important sentences from input documents while ensuring that the extracted information is non redundant(  e g,  methods base don based on maximum marginal relevance Carbon ell and Gold stein,  1998. 
mention only work based on discourse relations Mar cu,  Louis et al,  2010. 
When relating discourse processing techniques to automatic summarization,  Nenkova and McKeown,  2011. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
The second uses latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
In (0017):
In existing unsupervised methods,  Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  is used for sentence selection sentences election. 
Unsupervised methods do not require training data such as human made summaries to train the summarizer(  Nomoto & Yuji,  2001; Buckley & Walz,  1999; Gong & Liu,  2001)  Recently,  many generic document summarization methods using Latent Semantic Analysis(  LSA)  have been proposed(  Gong & Liu,  2001; Li,  Li,  & Wu,  2006; Yeh et al,  2005; Zha,  2002). 
The second method uses a latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to semantically identify important sentences for summary creations. 
In (Wang and Li 2012):
Gong and Liu(  2001)  propose a method using latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to select highly ranked sentences for summarization. 
In addition,  latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  and nonnegative matrix factorization(  NMF)  have also been used to produce the summaries by selecting semantically and probabilistically important sentences in the documents(  Gong & Liu,  2001). 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
In this article,  a sentence based abstraction technique for information extraction is presented. 
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
(  Vickrey and Koller,  2008)  applies similar techniques,  using a sequence of rule based simp li fications of sentences,  to preprocess documents for Semantic Role Labeling. 
They applied this technique to extractive summarization in(  Rusu et al,  2009)  by building what the authors call semantic graphs,  derived from triplets,  and then using said graphs to identify the most interesting sentences for the summary. 
The work of(  Beigman Klebanov et al,  2004)  simplifies sentences by using MINIPAR parses as a starting point,  in a process similar to ours,  for the purpose of helping information seeking applications in their own task. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
the type of statistical information extracted,  the representation chosen for the extracted information,  the method of similarity calculation. 
The AutoSummENG method for summarization evaluation is a promising method based on language neutral analysis of texts and comparison to gold standard summaries. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
Extractive summaries are formulated by extracting key text segments(  sentences or passages)  from the text,  based on statistical analysis of individual or mixed surface level features such as word phrase frequency,  location or cue words to locate the sentences to be extracted. 
Text Summarization is condensing the source text into a shorter version preserving its information content and overall meaning. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
Recent work in multi document summarization has leveraged information about the topics mentioned in a collection of documents in order to generate informative and coherent textual summaries. 
The scores obtained in both the automatic ROUGE evaluation and in the manual Pyramid evaluation ranked highest the summaries that used sentence extraction and compression methods based on theme representations that organize information associated with a set of themes as a linked list. 
Automatic text summarization has drawn a lot of interest in the natural language processing and information retrieval communities in recent years. 
In (Yang et-al. 2014):
Sentence clustering plays a pivotal role in theme based summarization,  which discovers topic themes defined as the clusters of highly related sentences in order to avoid redundancy and cover more diverse information. 
Most of the summarization work done till date is based on the sentence extraction framework,  which ranks sentences according to various prespecified criteria and then selects the most salient sentences from the original documents to form a concise summary. 
Ranking based clustering Sentence clustering Theme based summarization. 
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Our approach addresses these issues by using domain independent techniques based mainly on fast,  statistical processing,  a metric for reducing redundancy and maximizing diversity in the selected passages,  and a modular framework to allow easy parameterization for different genres,  corpora characteristics and user requirements. 
This paper discusses a text extraction approach to multi document summarization that builds on single document summarization methods by using additional,  available information about the document set as a whole and the relationships between the documents. 
Most of the work in sentence extraction applied statistical techniques(  frequency analysis,  variance analysis,  etc)  to linguistic units such as tokens,  names,  anaphora,  etc   More recently,  other approaches have investigated the utility of discourse structure(  Mar cu,  1997) ,  the combination of information extraction and language generation(  Klavans and Shaw,  1995; McKeown et al,  1995) ,  and using machine learning to find patterns in text(  Teufel and Mo ens,  1997; Barzilay and Elhadad,  1997; Strzalkowski et al,  1998). 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (0017):
We propose a new unsupervised method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF)  to select sentences for automatic generic document summarization. 
Asa result,  LSArelated methods of document summarization may fail to extract meaningful sentences(  Lee & Seung,  1999; Zha,  2002)  In this paper,  we propose a new unsupervised generic document summarization method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF). 
While generic summarization distills the summarized text and presents the important semantic content of given documents,  query based summarization presents the summaries that are closely related to the query(  Mar cu,  1999; Mani & May bury,  1999; Mani,  2001)  Generally,  a document is comprised of major and minor topics. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
Wang et al  (  2008)  proposed a framework based on sentence level semantic analysis and symmetric NMF(  nonnegative matrix factorization). 
Wang,  Li,  and Ding(  2010)  proposed the weighed feature subset nonnegative matrix factorization(  WFSNMF) ,  which is an unsupervised approach to simultaneously cluster data points and select important features and different data points are assigned different weights indicating their importance. 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
We demonstrate structured DPPs on a toy geographical paths problem,  a still image multiple pose estimation task,  and two high dimensional text threading tasks. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
Multi document extractive summarization deals with extraction of summarized information from multiple texts written about the same topic. 
BAYESUM leverages the common case in which multiple documents are relevant to a single query. 
If users create query words the way they create for information retrieval,  then the query based summary generation would become generic summarization. 
In query based text summarization. 
In (Sarkar 2010):
Multi document summarization is a process,  which produces a condensed representation of the contents of multiple related text documents collected from heterogeneous sources for human consumption and facilitates very rapid assimilation by human beings of the main points from related documents. 
(  1)  extracting important textual units from multiple related documents, (  2)  removing redundancies and(  3)  reordering or fusion of the units to produce a fluent summary. 
In extractive multi document summarization task,  summary sentences come from multiple source documents,  and picking sentences out of context may result in an incoherent summary. 
In (Khan et-al. 2015):
(  1)  fully automatic summarization of single news wire newspaper document, (  2)  fully automatic summarization of multiple news wire newspaper documents on single subject by generating document extracts and(  3)  fully automatic summarization of multiple news wire newspaper documents on single subject by generating document abstracts. 
In this paper,  we propose a framework that will automatically fuse similar information across multiple documents and use language generation to produce a concise abs tractive summary. 
exploits template based method to produce abs tractive summary from multiple news wire newspaper documents depending on the output of the information extraction(  IE)  system. 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  modeled extractive document summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
Takamura and Okumura(  a)  represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint(  MCKP). 
A good summary,  as whole,  is expected to be the one with extensive coverage of the focuses presented in documents,  minimum redundancy,  and smooth connection among sentences. 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  represented each sentence with a set of conceptual units and formalized the extractive summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
In (Liu et-al. 2015):
Although some methods tried to reduce the redundancy(  Li et al   2009) ,  nding balance between wide coverage and minimum redundancy is anon trivial task In this paper,  an ideal summary is assumed to represent the whole document set,  namely,  by reading the summarization instead of the whole set one can understand the general idea of the original documents. 
Multi document summarization is the process of generatinga short version of given materials to indicate its main ideas As the number of documents on the web exponentially increases,  text summarization has attracted a growth of attention since it can help people get the topic within a short time Most existing studies are extraction based methods. 
techniques is that they seem to ignore the redundancy and coverage in summarization Sparse coding is proved to be very useful in image processing(  denoting,  in painting,  super resolution). 
4.11-tSummarization of documents through a progressive technique for selection of sentences
4.12-tEvaluation of sentence scoring methods for extractive summarization of text
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
We analyze and compare two di erent methods for unsupervised extractive spontaneous speech summarization in the meeting domain. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
For example,  while summarizing broadcast news is very similar to the summarization of textual documents,  conversations are much less structured and involve the interaction between multiple speakers Approachesforspeech summarization are mostly extractive and result in a selection of sentences from the input utterances. 
In (Ferreira et-al. 2013):
Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive. 
In (Otterbacher et-al. 2009):
In the current paper,  we have also demonstrated the e ectiveness of our method as applied to two classical IR problems,  extractive text summarization and passage retrieval for question answering. 
There are various de nit ions of text summarization resulting from di erent approaches to solving the problem Furthermore,  there is often no agreement as to what a good summary is even when we are dealing with a particular de nit ion of the problem. 
Text summarization is one of the hardest problems in information retrieval,  mainly because it is not very well de ned.

A comprehensive evaluation in Uz da et al  (  2008)  has concluded that automatic text summarization methods which are based on RST are better than extractive summarizers and those with hybrid methods produce worse summaries. 
In this paper we present an automatic extractive Arabic text summarization system where the user can cap the size of the final summary. 
Automatic text summarization is an essential tool in this era of information overloading.

Text summarization,  the process of automatically creating a shorter version of one or more text documents,  is an important way of finding relevant information in large text libraries or in the Internet. 
In (Sipos et-al. 2012):
In this paper,  we present a supervised learning approach to training sub modular scoring functions for extractive multi document summarization. 
The learning method applies to all sub modular summarization methods,  and we demonstrate its effectiveness for both pairwise as well as coverage based scoring functions on multiple data sets. 
Sentence extraction can also be implemented using other graph based scoring approaches(  Mihalcea,  2004)  such as HITS(  Klein berg,  1999)  and positional power functions.

Text Summarization methods can be classified into extractive and abs tractive summarization. 
Text Summarization is condensing the source text into a shorter version preserving its information content and overall meaning. 
In (Ganesan et-al. 2010):
Going strictly by the definition of true abstraction(  Radev et al,  2002) ,  our problem formulation is still more extractive than abs tractive because the generated summary can only contain words that occur in the text to be summarized our problem definition may be regarded as a word level(  finer granularity)  extractive summarization. 
Graphs have been commonly used for extractive summarization(  e g,  LexRank(  Erk an and Radev,  2004)  and TextRank(  Mihalcea and Tarau,  2004) ) ,  but in these works the graph is often undirected with sentences as nodes and similarity as edges. 
Extractive methods also tend to be verbose and this is especially problematic when the summaries need to be viewed on smaller screens like on a PDA. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
In particular,  we model text summarization as an integer linear programming problem. 
A transductive approach(  Amini & Usunier,  2009)  for extractive multi document summarization identifies topic themes within a document collection,  which help to identify two sets of relevant and irrelevant sentences to a question. 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
Hence,  there is a need for novel graph based summarizers that also consider the correlations among multiple terms and the differences between positive and negative term correlations. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded.

In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005). 
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
To solve the optimization problem has been created an improved differential evolution algorithm. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
A parallel effort has been devoted to using clustering algorithms for summarizing documents. 
This paper presents GraphSum,  a general purpose graph based summarizer that combines the association rules that were extracted from the analyzed documents in a graph based model in order to consider the correlations among multiple terms during the summarization process. 
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms.

In (Aliguliyev 2009):
The differential evolution algorithm for optimization procedure is given in Section 4. 
A key characteristic of many partition al clustering algorithms is that they use a global criterion function whose optimization drives the entire clustering process. 
In its classical form,  the DE algorithm is only applicable for optimization of continues variables. 
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
For example,  while summarizing broadcast news is very similar to the summarization of textual documents,  conversations are much less structured and involve the interaction between multiple speakers Approachesforspeech summarization are mostly extractive and result in a selection of sentences from the input utterances. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
Beside extending the concept idea as mentioned above,  one could think of integrating some utterance level scores(  e g,  grammaticality,  automatic speech recognition con dence,  length or number of concepts contained)  directly to the optimization problem This can help avoiding the inclusion of short,  illformedor aborted utterances containing high value key phrases Xie et al  (  a)  introduced a rst step towards augmenting the concept based algorithm by integrating sentence weights.

In our work,  we have considered both, (  1)  component based evaluations,  which evaluated each phase in the creation of a multi document summary separately,  and(  2)  intrinsic evaluations,  which evaluate the quality of each individual multi document summary generated by a summarization system. 
Now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust multi document summarization(  MDS)  systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary.

In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
More recently,  single document summarization systems provide an automated generic abstract or a query relevant summary(  TIPSTER,  a). 
i However,  large scale IR and summarization have not yet been truly integrated,  and the functionality challenges on a summarization system are greater in a true IR or topic detection context(  Yang et al,  1998; Allan et al,  1998).

Knowledge poor approaches do not consider any knowledge pertaining to the domain to which text summarization is applied therefore,  knowledge poor approaches can be easily applied to any domain(  Abracos & Lopes,  1997; Gong & Liu,  2001; Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; May eng & Jang,  1999; Salton et al,  1997; Mitra,  Singh al,  & Buckley,  1997).

In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
As mentioned in Section 1,  motivated by the success of PageRanklike ranking algorithms in webpage ranking,  a number of graph based approaches have been applied to automatic text summarization. 
When applied to the task of text summarization,  these approaches can make full use of the relationships between sentences and find the most important sentences to be extracted into the summary. 
However,  such approaches to query expansion are restricted in what they can expand,  because they cannot be applied to words not in WordNet such as named entities which frequently occur in queries,  and without performing word sense disambiguation,  adding all the synonyms of a word will inevitably bring noises,  and furthermore,  much context related information cannot be captured by only synonyms. 
In (Kallimani et-al. 2011):
The previous work in automatic summarization has completely focused on extractive summarization,  in which key sentences are identified from the source text and extracted to form the output. 
An alternative solution is abs tractive summarization in which the information from the source text is first extracted into the form of abstract data which is then post processed to infer the most important message from the original text. 
We modeled the problem of text summarization as an IR problem. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):

In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
Our framework differs from previous abs tractive summarization models in requiring a semantic analysis of the text. 
Most systems develop ped for the main international conference on text summarization,  the Text Analysis Conference(  TAC) (  Owczarzak and Dang,  2010) ,  predominantly use sentence extraction,  including all the top ranked systems,  which make only minor post editing of extracted sentences(  Conroy et al,  2010) (  Gil lick et al,  2009) (  Ge nest Gen est Gene st et al,  2008) (  Chen et al,  2008).

Speech summarization originated from the porting of methods developed for text summarization. 
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization
In (Pardo et-al. 2003b):
This paper presents a method for text summarization based on the gist of a source text that differs from the related ones in Computational Linguistics. 
Those are added to the extract provided that they satisfy summarization requirements,  namely,  gist preservation,  textuality,  relevance,  and compression constraints. 
Deep based approaches,  e g,  those based on the rhetorical structuring of source texts,  address nuclearity to select relevant information. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
This paper proposes two approaches to address text summarization. 
Table 1 shows the outputs of our approaches in different phases of the text summarization process. 
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
Knowledge poor approaches do not consider any knowledge pertaining to the domain to which text summarization is applied therefore,  knowledge poor approaches can be easily applied to any domain(  Abracos & Lopes,  1997; Gong & Liu,  2001; Hovy & Lin,  1997; Kupiec et al,  1995; Lin,  1999; May eng & Jang,  1999; Salton et al,  1997; Mitra,  Singh al,  & Buckley,  1997). 
In (Kulkarni and Prasad 2010):
This study describes three approaches to Automated Text Summarization using connectionist statures based on. 
Authors have surveyed the current text summarization approaches(  Afantenos et al,  2005; Ledeneva et al,  2008)  their advantages and disadvantages and,  with the goal of identifying summarization techniques most suitable to generic text summarization. 
Over the past half a century,  the problem of text summarization has been addressed from many different perspective,  in various domains and using various paradigms. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
As mentioned in Section 1,  motivated by the success of PageRanklike ranking algorithms in webpage ranking,  a number of graph based approaches have been applied to automatic text summarization. 
When applied to the task of text summarization,  these approaches can make full use of the relationships between sentences and find the most important sentences to be extracted into the summary. 
However,  such approaches to query expansion are restricted in what they can expand,  because they cannot be applied to words not in WordNet such as named entities which frequently occur in queries,  and without performing word sense disambiguation,  adding all the synonyms of a word will inevitably bring noises,  and furthermore,  much context related information cannot be captured by only synonyms. 
In (Kallimani et-al. 2011):
The previous work in automatic summarization has completely focused on extractive summarization,  in which key sentences are identified from the source text and extracted to form the output. 
An alternative solution is abs tractive summarization in which the information from the source text is first extracted into the form of abstract data which is then post processed to infer the most important message from the original text. 
We modeled the problem of text summarization as an IR problem. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
Multi document summarization Text mining Association rule mining Graph ranking. 
The multi document summarization task entails generating a summary of a collection of textual documents. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
There are several approaches to Text Summarization,  such as those proposed by(  Hovy and Mar cu 1998; Mani and May bury 1999; Tucker 1999; Radev 2000; May bury and Mani 2001; Mani 2001; Alonso and Castellon 2001). 
The text will be retrieved for the common search engine and then the text will be analyzed to find out if they are really relevant according to user s interested profile in order to provide concise summary of the retrieved subset of the relevant documents using the multi document summarization facilities. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
In paper,  we propose an unsupervised text summarization model which generates a summary by extracting salient sentences in given document(  s). 
Many approaches have been proposed for text summarization based on the diversity. 
Tao et al  (  2008)  have designed word based and sentence based association networks(  WAN and SAN for short,  respectively)  and proposed word and sentence weighting approaches based on how much co occurrence information they contain,  and applied to text summarization. 
8-tSummary evaluation
8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Patel et-al. 2007):
One of the measures in informativeness methodology for extractive summary evaluation is content based evaluation i e. 
So,  evaluation in terms of informativeness is usually preferred. 
The first is Quality evaluation and the second is an informativeness evaluation. 
Degree of Evaluation has been debatable for long time. 
Section gives details of material and evaluation strategies used. 
8.2-tQuality evaluation9-tEvaluation results
8.3-tAsiya, an evaluation toolkit
In (He et-al. 2012):
We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence. 
Due to limited space,  more information can be referred to the toolkit package. 
Table 1 and Table 2 show the ROUGE evaluation results on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 data sets respectively. 
In (Mihalcea and Tarau 2004):
Fo reach For each article,  TextRank generates an words summary the task undertaken by other systems participating in this single document summarization task For evaluation,  we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit,  which is a method based on Ngramstatistics,  found to be highly correlated with human evaluations(  Lin and Hovy,  2003). 
The sentences with the highest rank are selected for inclusion in the abstract For this sample article,  the sentences with ids 9,  15,  16,  18 are extracted,  resulting in a summary of about words,  which according to automatic evaluation measures,  is ranked the second among summaries produced by 15 other systems(  see Section 4.2 fo revaluation for evaluation fore valuation methodology). 
In this paper,  we introduce TextRank – a graphbasedranking model for text processing,  and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. 
In (Wang and Li 2012):
We use ROUGE(  Lin & Hovy,  2003)  toolkit(  version 1.5.5)  to measure the summarization performance,  which is widely applied by DUC for performance evaluation. 
To evaluate the summarization results empirically,  we use the DUC2002 and DUC2004 data sets,  both of which are open benchmark data sets from Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  for generic automatic summarization evaluation. 
Multi document summarization is a fundamental tool for document understanding and has received much attention recently. 
In (Liu et-al. 2015):
The length of a result summary is limited by 250 tokens(  white space whites pace delimited)  Evaluation Metric We use the Rouge(  Lin 2004)  evaluation toolkit,  which is adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
In this study,  we use the standard summarization benchmark DUC2006 and DUC2007 for evaluation Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  has organized yearly evaluation of document summarization. 
Multi document summarization is of great value to many tom any real world applications since it can help people get the main ideas within a short time. 
In (Aliguliyev 2009):
The second measure we use the ROUGE toolkit(  Lin et al,  2003,  Lin,  2004)  for evaluation,  which was adopted by DUC for automatically summarization evaluation. 
For evaluation the performance of our methods we used two document data sets DUC01 and DUC02 and corresponding word summaries generated for each of documents. 
The technology of automatic document summarization is maturing and may provide a solution to the information overload problem. 
8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
This is a welcome volume for both researchers and teachers who are interested in extending the traditional boundaries of Information Retrieval to include related information access and analytic applications such as summarization,  extraction,  and question answering Text summarization,  which is de ned by the editors as the process of distilling the most important information from a source(  s)  to produce an abridged version for a particular user(  s)  and task(  s)  ” is a technology that has been worked on for more than forty years anda capability that users have long desired. 
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting. 
Classical Approaches CorpusBased Approaches Exploiting DiscourseStructure; KnowledgeRich Approaches Evaluation Methods,  and New SummarizationProblem Areas.Following the general introduction is an excellent piece by Karen Spar ck Jones that provides a framework for understanding the task of summarization and calls for a doable research strategy that should serve to provide useful technology in the near future using what is already known in NLP.
