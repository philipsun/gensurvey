Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey
1-tIntroduction
1.1-tNeed of text summarization
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Furthermore,  considering that numerous textual sources provide information about the same real world events,  the need for aggregating and summarizing the most relevant information has become obvious. 
We chose these particular kernels because their general forms have intuitive interpretations for event matching and can be easily adjusted to fit our needs for event centered text comparison. 
The proposed model is extractive(  summaries are built by extracting sentences from the original texts)  and non focused(  the summarization is not guided by a specific information need). 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
For instance,  the parts could be positions ona context free grammar,  and then an element of Y might be a complete parse of a sentence This assumption of structure will give us the algorithmic leverage we need to e ciently work with a distribution over a doubly exponential number of possibilities Because elements of Y are now structures,  we will no longer think of Y = {1,  2,. 
(  Perhaps we think students tend to spread out)  In this context each meeting of the class is a new sample from the empirical distribution over subsets of the(  xed)  seats,  so we merely need to collect enough samples and we should be able to t our model,  as desired For many problems,  however,  the notion of a single xed base set Y is inadequate. 
This poses an extreme computational challenge In order to develop e cient structured DPPs(  SDPPs) ,  we will therefore need to combine the dynamic programming techniques used for standard structured prediction with the algorithms that make DPP inference e cient. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The cause of this low score is mostly our method for text generation,  which still needs to be refined in several ways. 
This seemingly unreachable goal,  equivalent to machine reading,  can be limited to the extent that we only need INITs to be precise and accurate enough to generate a summary from them. 
Most INITs do not lead to full sentences,  and need to be combined into a sentence structure before being realized as text. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
According to Mani and May bury(  1999) ,  automatic text summarization takes a partially structured source text from multiple texts written about the same topic,  extracts information content from it,  and presents the most important content to the user in a manner sensitive to the user s needs. 
Thus,  now more than ever,  consumers need access to robust text summarization systems,  which can effectively condense information found in several documents into a short,  readable synopsis,  or summary(  Harabagiu and Lacatusu,  2010,  Yang and Wang,  2008). 
As compared to generic summarization that must contain the core information central to the source documents,  the main goal of query focused multi document summarization is to create from the documents a summary that can answer the need for information expressed in the topic or explain the topic. 
2-tVarious types of text Summarization
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
There are various types of correlation measures,  called correlation coef cients,  depending on the context in which they can be applied. 
Even though a series of numerous experiments has already been conducted,  we feel that the presented method should be further investigated as it may hold implications concerning the potential for using the graph representation in a language neutral way for various NLP tasks. 
Trying to capture more than the simple co occurrence of words and in order to allow for different types of the same word,  our method uses character ngrams positioned within a context indicative graph. 
3-tClassification of extractive approaches for summary generation
3.1-tStatistical based approaches
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
Simpler approaches were then explored that consist of extracting representative text spans texts pans,  using statistical techniques and or techniques based on surface domain independent linguistic analyses. 
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Our approaches have been used the feature extraction criteria which gives researchers opportunity to use many varieties of these features based on the used language and the text type. 
3.2-tTopic based approaches
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
Hennig and Labor(  2009)  proposed a multi document summarization method based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(  PLSA) ,  which represents sentences and queries as probability distributions over latent topics. 
This technique allows users to easily understand a topic by looking at a short summary. 
Furthermore,  WordNetbased approaches fail to analyze proper nouns(  e g,  a person s name or the name of a product or firm)  and newly coined words because these words are not present in WordNet. 
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
We then identified and extracted high scored sentences and then the Vector Space approach is used to measure the relatedness similarity between the extracted sentence and the topic words involving again the WordNet lexical database relationships to prioritise the topically related sentences. 
3.3-tGraph based approaches
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
In this article,  we present event graphs,  a novel event based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. 
To construct the event graphs,  we combine machine learning and rule based models to extract sentence level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. 
The information retrieval model measures the similarity between queries and documents by computing graph kernels over event graphs. 
3.4-tDiscourse based approaches
In (Gupta et-al. 2011):
Based on this classification,  automatic summarizers can be characterized as approaching the problem at the surface,  entity,  or discourse level. 
In this paper,  our algorithm ranks sentences based on the sum of the scores of the words in each sentence involving approaches like term frequencies,  location of sentence in the text,  cue words and phrases,  word occurrences,  and measuring lexical similarity(  measuring chain score,  word score and finally sentence score)  for ranking the text units. 
Cohesion is thus a surface indicator of the discourse structure of a document. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
Entity level approaches model text entities and their relationships co occurrence,  co reference,  etc,  and determine salient information based on the text entity model(  Azzam et al,  1999; McKeown & Radev,  1995). 
Sections 3 Modified corpus based approach,  4 LSA give a detail description of our proposed approaches. 
3.5-tApproaches based on machine learning
4-t Recent automatic text summarization extractive approaches
4.1-tTrained summarizer and latent semantic analysis for summarization of text
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
Text summarization Corpus based approach Latent semantic analysis Text relationship map. 
The second uses latent semantic analysis(  LSA)  to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. 
However,  most IR techniques that have been exploited in text summarization focus on symbolic level analysis,  and they do not take into account semantics such as synonymy,  polysemy,  and term dependency(  Hovy & Lin,  1997). 
4.2-tInformation extraction using sentence based abstraction technique
In (Chan 2006):
In this article,  a sentence based abstraction technique for information extraction is presented. 
Section V explains a sentence based abstraction technique,  which is a strategy that captures the dynamic influences of context and preference using an associative memory model. 
With the explosion in the quantity of online text and multimedia information in recent years,  there has been a renewed interest in the automated extraction of knowledge and information in various disciplines. 
At the syntactic stage,  information extraction involves tokenization,  partsofspeech tagging,  syntactic parsing,  phrasal pattern matching,  and the transformation of each sentence into an intermediate structure using various templates. 
In (Genest PE, Lapalme G 2011):
The work of(  Beigman Klebanov et al,  2004)  simplifies sentences by using MINIPAR parses as a starting point,  in a process similar to ours,  for the purpose of helping information seeking applications in their own task. 
(  Vickrey and Koller,  2008)  applies similar techniques,  using a sequence of rule based simp li fications of sentences,  to preprocess documents for Semantic Role Labeling. 
This abstract representation relies on the concept of Information Items(  INIT) ,  which we define as the smallest element of coherent information in a text or a sentence. 
4.3-tText understanding and summarization through document concept lattice
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
This task of document understanding(  Dang,  2005)  is a core issue in text summarization. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
Text summarization Document concept lattice Concept Semantic. 
Our summarizer based on the concept lattice has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005 and 2006 evaluations as well as follow on tests. 
Following our work in the Document Understanding Conference(  DUC)  2005 and 2006(  Ye et al,  2005,  Ye et al,  2006) ,  our summarization algorithm uses the DCL to select a globally optimum sentence set that represents as many concepts as possible with the fewest words. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
An abs tractive summarization method consists of understanding the original text and retelling it in fewer words. 
Text Summarization is condensing the source text into a shorter version preserving its information content and overall meaning. 
attempts to develop an understanding of the main concepts in a document and then express those concepts in clear natural language. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
In order to implement extractive summarization,  some sentence extraction techniques are utilized to identify the most important sentences,  which can express the overall understanding of a given document. 
4.4-tSentence extraction through contextual information and statistical based summarization of text
In (Giannakopoulos et-al. 2008):
The AutoSummENG method is based on the concept of using statistically ex tr acted tract ed textual information from summaries integrated into a rich representa tional equivalent of a text to measure similarity between generated summaries and a set of model summaries. 
the type of statistical information extracted,  the representation chosen for the extracted information,  the method of similarity calculation. 
The AutoSummENG method for summarization evaluation is a promising method based on language neutral analysis of texts and comparison to gold standard summaries. 
In (Gupta and Lehal 2010):
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
Extractive summaries are formulated by extracting key text segments(  sentences or passages)  from the text,  based on statistical analysis of individual or mixed surface level features such as word phrase frequency,  location or cue words to locate the sentences to be extracted. 
The importance of sentences is decided based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 
4.5-tSummarization of emails through conversational cohesion and subjective opinions
In (Carenini et-al. 2008):
As a third contribution of this paper,  we study how to make use of the subjective opinions expressed in emails to support the summarization task. 
Third,  we propose a summarization approach based on subjective opinions and integrate it with the graph based ones. 
We study how to summarize email conversations based on the conversational cohesion and the subjective opinions. 
We integrate our best cohesion measure together with the subjective opinions. 
Other than the conversation structure,  the measures of cohesion and the graph based summarization methods we have proposed,  the importance of a sentence in emails can be captured from other aspects. 
In (Zajic et-al. 2008):
We explored the email thread summarization problem using messages from the Enron corpus,  which consists of approximately half a million emails from the folders of 151 Enron employees. 
We present two approaches to email thread summarization. 
that CMS represents a better approach to email thread summarization,  and that current sentence compression techniques do not improve summarization performance in this genre. 
4.6-tSummarization of text through complex network approach
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we investigate a graph based,  language independent approach to extractive text summarization inspired by recent developments in the area of complex networks. 
The use of complex networks to represent texts appears therefore as suitable for automatic summarization,  consistent with the belief that the metrics of such networks may capture important text features. 
In this paper,  we employ concepts and metrics of complex networks to select sentences for an extractive summary. 
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
4.7-tAutomatic creation of generic document summaries through non-negative matrix factorization
In (Ferreira et-al. 2014):
The 2002 conference was the last one that proposed the contest to create generic multi document summaries. 
The main contribution of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an unsupervised generic summarization system,  that makes linguistic treatment of the input text by performing co reference resolution and discourse analysis,  besides using statistical and semantic similarities,  as in all previous work in the literature. 
The multi document summarization system proposed in this paper is based on statistical methods and linguistic treatment to increase information diversity of summaries also dealing with redundancy. 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
Wang,  Li,  and Ding(  2010)  proposed the weighed feature subset nonnegative matrix factorization(  WFSNMF) ,  which is an unsupervised approach to simultaneously cluster data points and select important features and different data points are assigned different weights indicating their importance. 
Wang et al  (  2008)  proposed a framework based on sentence level semantic analysis and symmetric NMF(  nonnegative matrix factorization). 
4.8-tAutomatic text summarization using MR, GA, FFNN, GMM and PNN based models
In (Fattah and Ren 2009):
This work proposes an approach to address the problem of improving content selection in automatic text summarization by using some statistical tools. 
Training mode where features are extracted from 100 manually summarized Arabic documents and 50 manually summarized English documents(  50 not 100 to investigate the training data set size effect on summarization performance)  and used to train GA,  MR,  FFNN,  PNN and GMM models. 
With the huge amount of information available electronically,  there is an increasing demand for automatic text summarization systems. 
In (Almeida and Martins 2013):
Automatic text summarization is a seminal problem in information retrieval and natural language processing(  Luhn,  1958; Baxendale,  1958; Edmund son,  1969). 
An alternative are coverage based models(  §2.1; Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou,  2004; Yih et al,  2007; Gil lick et al,  2008) ,  which seek a set of sentences that covers as many diverse concepts as possible redundancy is automatically penalized since redundant sentences cover fewer concepts. 
We present a dual decomposition framework for multi document summarization,  using a model that jointly extracts and compresses sentences. 
4.9-tQuery-based summarization of multiple documents by applying regression models
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
In contrast to tools like search,  which require the user to specify a query based on prior knowledge,  a set of threads provides an immediate,  concise,  high level summary of the collection,  not just identifying a set of important ob jects but also conveying the relationships between them. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
In (Otterbacher et-al. 2009):
In this paper,  we focus on the query based or focused summarization problem where we seek to generate a summary of a set of related documents given a speci c aspect of their oft heir common topic formulated as a natural language query. 
Our method is a query based extension of the LexRanksummarization method introduced in(  Erk an and Radev,  2004). 
A key challenge for passage retrieval for QA is that,  when attempting to retrieve answers to questions from a set of documents published by multiple sources over time(  e g. 
4.10-tMaximum coverage and minimum redundancy in summarization of text
In (Alguliev et-al. 2011):
Text summarization Maximum coverage Less redundancy Integer linear programming Particle swarm optimizationBranchandbound. 
In Takamura and Okumura(  2009) ,  Takamura and Okamura represented text summarization as maximum coverage problem with knapsack constraint. 
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou(  2004)  modeled extractive document summarization as a maximum coverage problem that aims at covering as many conceptual units as possible by selecting some sentences. 
4.11-tSummarization of documents through a progressive technique for selection of sentences
4.12-tEvaluation of sentence scoring methods for extractive summarization of text
In (Ferreira et-al. 2013):
Extractive summarization Sentence scoring methods Summarization evaluation. 
In terms of extractive summarization,  sentence scoring is the technique most used for extractive text summarization. 
Extractive techniques perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents according to some criteria. 
Essentially,  text summarization techniques are classified as Extractive and Abs tractive. 
This paper describes 15 sentence scoring methods,  and some variation of them,  widely used and referenced in the literature applied to single document summarization in the last 10 years. 
In (Antiqueira et-al. 2009):
Automatic summarization of texts is now crucial for several information retrieval tasks owing to the huge amount of information available in digital media,  which has increased the demand for simple,  language independent extractive summarization strategies. 
We have described the use of complex networks concepts for extractive summarization,  as well as its evaluation through standard informativeness scores and significance tests. 
Although extractive summarization can produce texts that have cohesion and coherence problems,  many systems have been proven to yield summaries whose informative level is satisfactory. 
In (Riedhammer et-al. 2010):
We analyze and compare two di erent methods for unsupervised extractive spontaneous speech summarization in the meeting domain. 
Evaluation measuresforsummarization performancelikeROUGE(  Lin,  2004)  or Pyramid(  Nenkova and Passonneau,  2004)  and later developments like Basic Elements(  Hovy et al,  2006)  score summaries based on an overlap of ngrams(  ROUGE) ,  summary content units(  manually annotated parts in the target text Pyramid)  or dependency parsing relations(  Basic Elements)  Formally,  let ci denote the presence of concept i in the summary and sj denote the presence of sentence j in the summary. 
The selected meeting extracts can then either be juxtaposed to form a short text summarizing a meeting or used as a starting point to enhance browsing experience Extractive summarization algorithms often rely on the measurement of two important aspects. 
4.13-tExploring correlations among multiple terms through a graph-based summarizer, GRAPHSUM
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
Hence,  there is a need for novel graph based summarizers that also consider the correlations among multiple terms and the differences between positive and negative term correlations. 
In fact,  on the one hand,  since they do not consider the underlying correlations among multiple terms,  some relevant facets of the analyzed data could be disregarded. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
We compare the expressive power of DPPs and MRFs,  characterizing the tradeo s in terms of modeling power and computational e ciency. 
In the rst,  we subtract a multiple of one of the vectors in V from all of the other vectors so that they are zero in the ithcomponent,  leaving us with a set of vectors spanning the subspace of V orthogonal to ei. 
• An image search task,  where we model human judgments of diversity for image sets returned by Google Image Search(  Section 5.3)  ;• A multiple pose estimation task,  where we improve the detection of human poses in images from television shows by incorporating a bias toward non overlapping predictions(  Section 6.4)  ;• A news threading task,  where we automatically extract timelines of important news stories from a large corpus by balancing intratimeline coherence with intertimelinediversity(  Section 6.6.4). 
4.14-tIncorporating various levels of language analysis for tackling redundancy in text summarization
4.15-tEvolutionary optimization algorithm for summarizing multiple documents
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
DE is a simple yet efficient evolutionary algorithm,  which has been widely applied to solve continuous optimization problems(  Price,  Storn,  & Lampinen,  2005). 
In addition to single document summarization,  which has been first studied in this field for years,  researchers have started to work on multi document summarization whose goal is to generate a summary from multiple documents. 
To solve the optimization problem has been created an improved differential evolution algorithm. 
4.16-tSummarization of multiple documents using a hybrid machine learning model
4.17-tImproving clustering at sentence-level with the help of ranking-based technique for theme-based summarization
In (Yang et-al. 2014):
In this paper,  we propose a ranking based clustering framework that utilizes ranking distribution of documents and terms to help generate high quality sentence clusters. 
Sentence clustering plays a pivotal role in theme based summarization,  which discovers topic themes defined as the clusters of highly related sentences in order to avoid redundancy and cover more diverse information. 
Ranking based clustering Sentence clustering Theme based summarization. 
Thus,  good sentence clusters are the guarantee of good summaries in theme based summarization. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
We first discuss a total of six different sentence extraction methods(  EM1– EM6)  which correspond to the four baseline topic representation techniques(  TR1–TR4) ,  introduced in Section 2,  plus the two topic theme based representations based on TR5 introduced in Section 3.16 For ease of exposition,  we will refer to the graph based theme representation as TH1 and the linked list based theme representation as TH2. 
Second,  we believe that our results represent a comprehensive and replicable study,  which demonstrates the effectiveness of a structured,  theme based approach to multi document summarization. 
We believe that these results prove the benefits of using the theme based topic representation for multi document summarization. 
4.18-tStatistical and linguistic based summarization system for multiple documents

4.19-tMulti-document summarization based information retrieval using event graphs
4.20-textractive summarization of single documents through genetic operators and guided local search
4.21-t Topic-aspect based summarization through selection of groups
In (Fang et-al. 2015):
Considering the summaries from multi documents of one topic can describe various aspects of one given topic,  this paper attempts to exploit appropriate priors to generate topic aspect oriented summarization(  abbreviated as TAOS). 
As a result,  controls the selection of groups of,  as well as the groups of features,  which represents the preferred aspects in our summarization task. 
Therefore,  in this paper,  we attempt to devise an approach to the generation of the topic aspect oriented summarization according to topic factors,  we call this TAOS(  Topic AspectOriented Summarization). 
In (Alguliev et-al. 2013):
This paper proposes an optimization based model for generic document summarization. 
Binwahlan,  Salim,  and Suanmali(  2010)  introduced a different hybrid model based on fuzzy logic,  swarm intelligence and diversity selection for text summarization problem. 
The experimental results provide strong evidence that the proposed optimization based approach is a viable method for document summarization. 
4.22-tSummarization of multiple documents based on social Folksonomy by analyzing semantically
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
Many approaches to multi document summarization have used probability based methods and machine learning techniques to simultaneously summarize multiple documents sharing a common topic. 
In this paper,  we propose FoDoSu which is a novel multi document summarization system using tag clusters from a Folksonomy system to detect the key sentences in multiple documents. 
In (Baralis et-al. 2013):
Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
However,  since the high order correlations among multiple terms are disregarded during graph evaluation,  the summarization performance could be limited unless integrating ad hoc language dependent or semantics based analysis. 
This paper presents GraphSum,  a general purpose graph based summarizer that combines the association rules that were extracted from the analyzed documents in a graph based model in order to consider the correlations among multiple terms during the summarization process. 
4.23-tOther text summarization approaches
4.23.1-tLearning-based approach for summarizing related sentences
4.23.2-tSemantic role labeling with minimal resources
In (Khan et-al. 2015):
In this framework,  contents of the source documents are represented by predicate argument structures by employing semantic role labeling. 
Our work,  in contrast,  aims to treat this limitation by using semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique to build semantic representation from the document text automatically. 
First,  it employs semantic role labeling for semantic representation of text. 
To the best of our knowledge,  semantic role labeling(  SRL)  technique,  which exploits semantic role parser,  has not been employed for the semantic representation oftextin multi document abs tractive summarization. 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
Second,  by restricting it to a small number of generic argument types,  we make the extraction more robust,  avoiding the performance issues typically associated with fine grained semantic role labeling approaches. 
The extraction performance for all types except LOCATION is satisfactory(  and,  though not directly comparable,  is above the 70% F score typical for semantic role labeling systems). 
Query document matches are recognized based on a comparison of entities occupying the same semantic roles of the matching predicates. 
4.23.3-tSummarizing single documents through nested tree structure
4.23.4-tTwo-level sparse representation model for summarization of multiple documents
In (Liu et-al. 2015):
Similar to(  Yang et al   2013) ,  the two level sparse representation model we introduced is NPhard,  we use simulated annealing algorithm to get the summarization To our knowledge,  this is the rst paper that utilizes cover. 
We design a two level sparse representation model to extract multi document summarization The original document set is sparsely represented by summary sentences. 
Based on the data reconstruction and sentence de noising assumption,  we present a twolevelsparse representation model to depict the process ofmultidocument summarization. 
In (Yang et-al. 2013):
We have leveraged the dictionary learning for sparse representation model to construct the summary and to represent the image. 
We have discovered that the image collection summarization problem can be interpreted straightforwardly with the dictionary learning for sparse representation model under the SIFT BoW framework. 
We have explicitly reformulated the problem of automatic image summarization by using an sparse representation model and the simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization function more effectively. 
4.23.5-tSparse-coding based reader-aware summarization system for multiple documents
In (CR92):
We propose a new MDS paradigm called reader aware multi document summarization(  RAMDS)  Speci cally,  a set of reader comments associated with the news reports are also collected. 
Our framework can still be used for MDS task without reader comments by ignoring those components for comments Besides Random and Lead methods,  we compare our system with two other unsupervised sparse coding based methods,  namely DSDR He et al,  2012. 
(  3)  In our sparse coding model,  we weight the reconstruction error by a prior knowledge,  i e,  paragraph position,  which can improve the summarization performancesigni cantly. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
In this paper,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system,  called FoDoSu(  Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization) ,  that employs the tag clusters used in Folksonomy systems to detect key sentences in multiple documents. 
In this paper,  we propose FoDoSu which is a novel multi document summarization system using tag clusters from a Folksonomy system to detect the key sentences in multiple documents. 
In (Yang et-al. 2013):
(  a)  Online shopping sites generate multiple icon images(  i e,  image summary)  for each product category by selecting a limited number of the most representative pictures(  b)  Tourism websites provide a small set of the most representative photos from large scale photo gallery and display the photos on their web page to attract visitors,  which may further result in low information overload on user navigation(  c)  Online image recommendation system learns the user intention in real time and recommends a small amount of most representative images out of a large collection. 
An interactive image navigation system is designed,  which can provide a good platform for users to interactively assess the performance of various algorithms for automatic image summarization. 
can only be considered as an alternative to the sparse coding stage of our proposed work. 
In (Radev et-al. 2001):
We will introduce an e ective search engine to summarize clusters of related web pages which provide more contextual and summary information to help users explore the retrieval result more e ciently We describe in this paper a system,  WebInEssence,  which blends the traditional information retrieval technology with advanced document clustering,  document recommendation,  and multi document summarization technology in an integrated framework Text summarization is the process of selecting the most salient information in one or more textual documents. 
Both single document summarization for a single URL and multiple document summarization for a cluster of URLs are supported in our system More related work can be found on the Extractor web site. 
In this paper,  we present our recent work on the development of a scalable personalized webbasedmultidocument summarization and recommendation system. 
4.23.6-tSummarization of multiple documents through recursive neural networks based ranking approach
In (Cao et-al. 2015a):
We develop a Ranking framework upon Recursive Neural Networks(  R2N2)  to rank sentences for multi document summarization. 
This paper presents a Ranking framework upon Recursive Neural Networks(  R2N2)  for the sentence ranking task of multi document summarization. 
To this end,  we develop a ranking framework upon recursive neural networks(  R2N2)  to rank sentences for multi document summarization. 
4.23.7-tGraph-based extractive summarization by considering importance, non-redundancy and coherence

We propose a graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization which considers importance,  non redundancy and local coherence simultaneously. 
Therefore,  in our work,  computing importance,  non redundancy and coherence is tightly integrated and taken care of simultaneously Our graph based summarization technique has the further advantage of being completely unsupervised We apply our graph based summarization technique to scienti c articles from the journal PLOS Medicine,  a high impact open access journal from the medical domain. 
While previous work uses a measure of local coherence only to evaluate the local coherence of summaries,  we integrate it closely with determining importance and avoiding redundancy in an unsupervised graph based method for extractivesingledocument summarization. 
In (Glavaš G, Šnajder J 2014):
In this work,  we present an extractive multi document summarization model based on the extraction of sentence level event mentions and the temporal structure of documents. 
Our approach is similar to that of Canhasi and Kononenko in that we also use a graph based structure(  event graphs)  to refine the importance scores of sentences. 
The extractive multi document summarization model selects sentences based on the relevance of the individual event mentions and the temporal structure of events. 
4.23.8-tSparse optimization based compressive document summarization
4.23.9-t Submodular mixtures based summarization of multi-document hierarchy of topics
In (Bairi et-al. 2015):
Several real world machine learning applications involve hierarchy based categorization of topics for a set of objects. 
Given a collection of articles spanning different topics,  but with similar titles,  automatically generate a disambiguation page for those titles using the Wikipedia category hierarchy as a topic DAG. 
Let G(  V,  E)  be the DAG structured topic hierarchy with V topics. 
Given a DAGstructured topic hierarchy and a subset of objects,  we investigate the problem of finding a subset of DAGstructured topics that are induced by that subset(  of objects). 
In (Ye et-al. 2007):
In this paper,  we propose a document concept lattice that indexes the hierarchy of local topics tied to a set of frequent concepts and the corresponding sentences containing these topics. 
We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many concepts in the original document(  s)  that can be preserved after summarization. 
In this paper,  we review and detail our approach to automatic,  multi document extractive summarization. 
In (Lin and Bilmes 2010):
ILP Algorithms,  however,  can sometimes either be expensive for large scale problems or themselves might only be heuristic without associated theoretical approximation guarantees In this paper,  we study graph based approaches for multi document summarization. 
Erk an and Radev(  2004)  introduced a stochastic graph based method,  LexRank,  for computing the relative importance of textual units for multi document summarization. 
In multi document summarization,  redundancy is aparticularly important issue since textual units from different documents might convey the same information. 
In (Zhao et-al. 2009):
This paper presents a novel query expansion method,  which is combined in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization,  so as to resolve the problem of information limit in the original query. 
Query focused summarization Query expansion Graph based ranking. 
Inspired by the success of graph based ranking,  we propose an approach of combining query expansion in the graph based algorithm for query focused multi document summarization. 
In (Bing et-al. 2015):
We propose an abstraction based multi document summarization framework that can construct new sentences by exploring more fine grained syntactic units than sentences,  namely,  noun verb phrases. 
Existing multi document summarization(  MDS)  methods fall in three categories. 
Most summarization systems adopt the extraction based approach which selects some original sentences from the source documents to create a short summary(  Erk an and Radev,  2004; Wan et al,  2007). 
4.23.10-tDisaster summarization through prediction of salient updates
In (Kedzie et-al. 2015):
Our system predicts sentence salience in the context of a large scale event,  such as a disaster,  and integrates these predictions into a clustering based multi document summarization system. 
We present a system for update summarization which predicts the salience of sentences with respect to an event and then uses these predictions to directly bias a clustering algorithm for sentence selection,  increasing the quality of the updates. 
While we evaluate these features in the domain of disasters,  this approach is generally applicable to many update summarization tasks. 
In (Kulesza and Taskar 2012):
For instance,  in Figure a weak pose detector favors large clusters of poses that are nearly identical,  but lteringthrough a DPP ensures that the nal predictions are well separated Throughout this survey we demonstrate applications for DPPs in a variety of settings,  including. 
• The DUC 2003/2004 text summarization task,  where we form extractive summaries of news articles by choosing diverse subsets of sentences(  Section 4.2.1)  ;. 
The goal of learning is to choose appropriate θ based on the training sample so that we can make accurate predictions on unseen inputs While there are a variety of ob jective functions commonly used for learning,  here we will focus on maximum likelihood learning(  or maximum likelihood estimation,  often abbreviatedMLE) ,  where the goal is to choose θ to maximize the conditional log likelihood of the Optimizing L is consistent under mild assumptions that is,  if the training data are actually drawn from a conditional DPP with parameter θ∗,  then the learned θ → θ∗ as T → Of course real data are unlikely to exactly follow any particular model,  but in any case reasonable probability estimates,  since maximizing L can be seen as minimizing the loglossthe maximum likelihood approach has the advantage of calibrating the DPP to produce on the training data To optimize the log likelihood,  we will use standard algorithms such as gradient ascent or LBFGS Nocedal,  1980. 
4.23.11-tSummarizing multiple documents through system combination
In (Goldstein et-al. 2000):
Another system(  Stein et al,  1999)  creates a multi document summary from multiple single document summaries,  an approach that can be suboptimal in some cases,  due to the fact that the process of generating the final multi document summary takes as input the individual summaries and not the complete documents. 
Conventional IR systems find and rank documents based on maximizing relevance to the user query(  Salton,  1970; van Rijsbergen,  1979; Buckley,  1985; Salton,  1989). 
Consider the situation where the user issues a search query,  for instance on a news topic,  and the retrieval system finds hundreds of closely ranked documents in response. 
In (Heu et-al. 2015):
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
For this purpose,  we exploit the tag clusters used by Flickr,  one of the most representative Folksonomy systems,  for summarizing multiple documents. 
To overcome these drawbacks,  we propose a novel multi document summarization system called FoDoSu,  or Folksonomybased MultiDocument Summarization,  that employs the tag clusters used by Flickr,  a Folksonomy system,  for detecting key sentences from multiple documents. 
4.23.12-tPhrase-based compressive cross-language summarization
4.23.13-t Re-evaluation of automatic summarization using BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE
In (Graham 2015):
An analysis of evaluation of summarization metrics was provided with an evaluation of BLEU and 192 variants of ROUGE. 
In total,  therefore,  when employing ROUGE for the evaluation of summarization systems,  there are 192(  8 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2)  possible system level variants to choose from. 
We subsequently replicate a recent large scale evaluation that relied on,  what we now know to be,  suboptimal ROUGE variants revealing distinct conclusions about the relative performance of stateoftheart summarization systems. 
In (Lin 2004):
In this paper,  we introduced ROUGE,  an automatic evaluation package for summarization,  and conducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic measures included in the ROUGE package using three years of DUC data. 
We found that(  1)  ROUGE2,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  and ROUGES worked well in single document summarization tasks, (  2)  ROUGE1,  ROUGEL,  ROUGEW,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 performed great in evalua ting very short summaries(  or headline like summaries) , (  3)  correlation of high 90% was hard to achieve for multi document summarization tasks but ROUGE1,  ROUGE2,  ROUGES4,  ROUGES9,  ROUGESU4,  and ROUGESU9 worked reasonably well when stop words were exc luded from match ing, (  4)  exclusion of stop words usually improved correlation,  and(  5)  correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references. 
Therefore,  how to evaluate summaries automatically has drawn a lot of at tent ion in the summarization research community in recent years. 
In (Dunlavy et-al. 2007):
We demonstrate the improved performance by a series of experiments using standard test sets from the Document Understanding Conferences(  DUC)  as measured by the best known automatic metric for summarization system evaluation,  ROUGE. 
The benefit of using QCS over such methods is that it is a fully automatic system for document retrieval,  organization,  and summarization. 
Much of the recent research on automatic text summarization systems is available in the proceedings of the 2001–2006 Document Understanding Conferences The focus of these conferences is the evaluation and discussion of summarization algorithms and systems in performing sets of tasks on several types of document collections. 
In (Harabagiu S, Lacatusu F 2005):
The problem of using topic representations for multi document summarization(  MDS)  has received considerable attention recently. 
,  we evaluated summaries using five variants of the ROUGE automatic summary evaluation algorithm. 
We have evaluated each of these summarization methods using a number of standard techniques,  including the ROUGE automatic scoring packages and the manual Pyramid evaluation method. 
In (0017):
We propose a new unsupervised method using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(  NMF)  to select sentences for automatic generic document summarization. 
As a result,  the method selects more meaningful sentences for generic document summarization than those selected using LSA.Ó 2008 Else vier Ltd. 
Document summarization is an essential technology to overcome this obstacle in technological environments Automatic document summarization is the process of reducing the size of documents while presenting the important semantic content.

6-tAbstractive approaches for text summarization
In (CR100):
In this section,  we explain previous work on recentabstractive summarization,  and we stress our novelty with respect to other similar approaches An approach for combining different fragments of information that have been extracted from one or more document sis documents is suggested in. 
In order to solve this limitation,  besides checking for the correctness of the sentences once they have been generated and filtering out those ones,  which do not satisfy the proposed constraints,  we would also need to apply some constraints based on the information sentences contain,  optimizing the set of generated sentences,  so that only the best ones with respect to their content are used With respect to the general results of the abstractiveapproaches,  since the length of the summaries is restricted to only 100 words,  when selecting the most important sentences before or after generating new sentences,  some of the oft he concepts may not be included. 
This paper focuses on abs tractive text summarization. 
In (Yeh et-al. 2005):
This paper proposes two approaches to address text summarization. 
Table 1 shows the outputs of our approaches in different phases of the text summarization process. 
According to the level of text processing,  Mani and May bury(  1999)  categorized text summarization approaches into surface,  entity,  and discourse levels. 
7-tMultilingual approaches for text summarization

Graph based summarization entails extracting a worthwhile subset of sentences from a collection of textual documents by using a graph based model to represent the correlations between pairs of document terms. 
Multi document summarization Text mining Association rule mining Graph ranking. 
The multi document summarization task entails generating a summary of a collection of textual documents.

In (Fung P, Ngai G 2006):
This article presents a multi document,  multilingual,  theme based summarization system based on modeling text cohesion(  story ow). 
We have presented a stochastic Hidden Markov Story Model for multilingual and multi document summarization. 
Conventional extractive summarization methods picks out salient sentences according to either their positions in the text and or closeness to the centroid sentence to be included in a summary. 
In (Gupta V 2013):
This paper concentrates on hybrid algorithm for multilingual summarization of Hindi and Punjabi documents. 
In addition to this,  it also suggests some new features for summarizing Hindi and Punjabi multilingual text.

8.1-tInformativeness evaluation
In (Banerjee et-al. 2015):
In manual evaluation,  our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and readability. 
Further,  manual evaluation by human judges shows that our technique produces summaries with acceptable linguistic quality and high informativeness. 
Evaluators were asked to rate the summaries based on informativeness(  the amount of information conveyed)  and linguistic quality(  readability of the summary).

In (He et-al. 2012):
We use the ROUGE(  RecallOriented Understudy for Gi sting Evaluation)  toolkit(  Lin 2004)  which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. 
We choose two automatic evaluation methods ROUGEN and ROUGEL in our experiment. 
ROUGE toolkit reports separate scores for 1,  2,  3 and gram,  and also for the longest common subsequence. 
8.4-tText summarization evaluation programs
In (Neto et-al. 2000):
This paper describes a text mining tool that performs two tasks,  namely document clustering and text summarization. 
In order to make our experiments more relevant,  we have used the evaluation thee valuation framework of a large scale project for evaluating text summarization algorithms. 
Our text summarization algorithm is based on computing the value of aTFISF(  term frequency – inverse sentence frequency)  measure for each word,  which is an adaptation of the conventional TFIDF(  term frequency – inverse document frequency)  measure of information retrieval. 
In (Mani and Maybury 1999):
This is a welcome volume for both researchers and teachers who are interested in extending the traditional boundaries of Information Retrieval to include related information access and analytic applications such as summarization,  extraction,  and question answering Text summarization,  which is de ned by the editors as the process of distilling the most important information from a source(  s)  to produce an abridged version for a particular user(  s)  and task(  s)  ” is a technology that has been worked on for more than forty years anda capability that users have long desired. 
Today s recognized information overload has exacerbated this need while advances in Natural Language Processing and statistical text processing appear ready to provide viable near term solutions The editors have compiled an excellent selection of papers on summarization,  with an even split between classical and contemporary papers thirteen of each,  with many of the contemporary contributions based on papers presented at the ACL/EACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Summarization,  held in Madrid,  Spain in The choice classical papers include the 1958 paper by Luhn on The AutomaticCreation of Literature Abstracts,  Edmund son s 1969 paper on New Methods in Automatic Extracting,  and the 1975 paper by Pollock and Zamora on Automatic AbstractingResearch at Chemical Abstracts readings which I always include in my course on Indexing and Abstracting.
